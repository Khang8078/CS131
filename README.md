Do you think the mean helpfulness value may differ significantly between different  customers or products?
-> I think the answer is Yes
-> Amazon allows its users to vote on the helpfulness of a review.  new products and low traffic products donâ€™t have enough helpfulness votes to accurately assess the review.
-> The effect of review extremity on the review's value is moderated by product category. Reviews with extreme ratings are less beneficial for experience goods than reviews with moderate ratings. For both product kinds, the review's depth has a beneficial impact on its usefulness, but the impact of review depth is moderated by the nature of the product. For search goods as opposed to experience goods, the depth of the review has a stronger beneficial impact on the usefulness of the review.
