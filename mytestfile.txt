1.
Answer: Venus would be warmer than Earth if the distance from the sun to them was the
only factor in determining the surface temperatures.
Explanation: If the surface temperatures of Earth and Venus were exclusively determined
by their distance from the sun, Venus would be warmer. Only in this case, the sunlight
received by Venus would be 93 percent greater than that received by Earth. If this were
the case and albedos were not taken into account, the average surface temperature on
Earth would be 5 C (41 F) and 55 C (131 F) on Venus.
2.
a. The global albedo of Earth is 30%
b. The global albedo of Venus is 70%
c. The planet which absorbs more actual sunlight is Earth.
Explanation: Earth absorbs 70% of the sunlight while the number for Venus is only 30%.
3.
a. The actual average surface temperature of Earth is 15 ℃ or 59 ℉
b. The actual average surface temperature of Venus is 480 ℃ or 896 ℉
4. The primary reason for the temperature differential between the two planets is the
respective atmospheres. The atmosphere of Earth is primarily composed of Nitrogen
(75%), whereas the atmosphere of Venus is primarily composed of Carbon Dioxide
(96%). Despite the fact that Earth absorbs more sunlight, Venus's high carbon dioxide
levels trap heat in the atmosphere, as we know from the greenhouse effect here on Earth.
