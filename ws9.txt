The things I liked best about this book were very interesting characters that made you think hard about them, a plot filled with suspense to the end, multiple subplots that merged well together, and a lean writing style that let me focus mostly on the characters and the provocative web I found them in.  This is a very thougthfully crafted story. I think most anyone would enjoy this novel.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-14

The amazon price was the least expensive.  The book is complete and comes with self evaluation software to see if one is ready for the A+ exam.

The way Card writes his characters as living breathing beings is wonderful. He doesn't just slap together a one dimensional character. The story moves rather slowly, but once you truly emerse yourself, it picks up. I was very shocked by the ending, but was overall pleased with the story and plotline. It isn't a happy story where everyone lives happily ever after, but then life isn't like that either.	2005-10-14

I did not like the idea that instead of Tarl Cabot we were now telling the story of a different Earth man who ends up on Gor, although the Jason Marshall trilogy was more interesting to me than the story of Judy Thornton, a woman brought to Gor as a captive in \\"Slave Girl of Gor.\\"  In the first volume of the trilogy, \\"Fighting Slave of Gor,\\" Marshall ends up on Gor when he tries to save Beverly Henderson from a Gorean slave trap.  The next thing the civilized Earth man knows he is a slave on Gor.  Starting out as the silk slave of the Lady Florence of Vonda, Marshall then becomes a Gorean gladiator, which gives him the opportunity to become free so that he can find Beverly, who now also a slave on Gor.<br /><br />\\"Rogue of Gor\\" is the middle volume in the trilogy and the novel and has Marshall searching for Beverly.  But since this is a trilogy you know that he is not going to find her until the final volume, \\"Guardsman of Gor.\\"  Instead, Marshall travels along the River Vosk to the port city of Victoria, north of Port Kar, and finds himself in the middle of a war between Glorious Ar and the Salerian Confederation as the pirate fleet seeks to control the waterways of Gor on which the cities are so dependent.  In terms of providing more action than sex, this is the one volume of the trilogy that delivers on that score and if you are waiting for Jason and Beverly to consummate their relationship in Gorean terms you have the last half of the next novel for all of that to play out (after a giant naval battle).  In this one he finds her on the slaver's block, buys her, and sets her free even though she insists she is a true slave and therefore does not desire freedom.<br /><br />There is a sense in which Norman is trying to get back to the basics, since the fight between Ar and the Salerian Confederation is not, at face value, part of the gigantic struggle between the Priest-Kings and the Kurii.  But the sexual philosophy of Gor is now becoming the dominant theme of Norman's stories.  The back of the original paperback declares, \\"Jason Marshall learned the meaning of manhood and the power of women, both dominant and submissive\\" on Gor, but clearly he has yet to fully accept his role in this society.  This time around Norman is educating a male rather than a female, which is usually the case in the Gor novels, and I think that you have to take such instruction at face value.<br /><br />The obvious assumption might be that most men would not need to be persuaded to live a life being a master, but when you consider the discussion that Jason and Beverly were having at the start of the trilogy before they ended up on Gor you have to admit that it is not exactly the sort of lifestyle to which a \\"civilized\\" man would aspire.  Clearly Norman is arguing men have to be carefully taught such beliefs almost as much as women, although you will never convince me the male of the species would require as much persuasion.  Consequently, whether you judge \\"Rogue of Gor\\" by the standard of either the best Gor adventures (\\"Nomads of Gor\\" and \\"Assassins of Gor\\") or the main testaments of Gorean sexuality (\\"Slave Girl of Gor,\\" \\"Kajira of Gor,\\" and \\"Dancing Girl of Gor\\"), it falls short.

Author Murray was given unprecedented access to Lyric Opera of Chicago's Opera Center for American Artists during the 2003-2004 season. This is Lyric Opera's training ground for young artists. Murray follows this group of twelve singers through coaching sessions, rehearsals, auditions and performances to give the reader a close-hand look at the rigorous intensity of this most glorious art form. Interspersed with this are chapthers which fill out the picture of what it takes to succeed in opera. There is a chapter devoted to the comprimario - singers who specialize in secondary characters. Another chapter is devoted to Pavarotti, a warning of what can happen when one achieves what Murray dubs 'sacred monster' status. A sacred monster, superstar, Pavarotti was undone at the end of his career by his enormous ego. This book is a wonderful gift for those opera lovers on your Christmas list this season.	2005-10-14

Being a stalwart fan of the fantasy genre I decided to put my skepticism aside, break down and give these \\"children's\\" books a go. This series is in line with a lot of classic entertainment touted as \\"children's\\" fare (e.g., original Bugs Bunny cartoons, The Hobbit, Chronicles of Narnia, among others): that is, much of it is aimed straight at the heart of adults. And it hits the mark.    I have finished the series up to Book Five and I must say that there have been some pretty grisly incidents for younger readers. However, one can assume that many of Rowling's younger readers have followed the books from the beginning, and grown as Harry Potter did. For the younger readers just starting, however, along about book four some of the material may be a tad startling or disconcerting.    In any case, I have found the writing to be thoroughly entertaining, particularly the effective use of tongue-in-cheek humor. There is a comical brattiness about many of the characters (professors, parents, and students alike) which plays pretty well. The childishness of the main characters can be a bit trying at times, I will admit; but it is forgivable and understandable...they are, after all, still kids.    The use of suggestion and mystery -- of questions that do not get answered till the end of the book -- can also be a bit trying at times, but it is also compelling and intriguing at the same time, and part of this author's trademark.    All in all, these are exciting, fast-paced books, truly classics in their own time, and I am duly impressed that they lived up to their hype in my mind, skeptic that I was. Five stars, for cripe's sake.	2005-10-14

You make your bid and see what the author thinks.  He explains the strengths and weaknesses of some of the likely choices.  You learn how not to wrong side NT contracts (missing stoppers, or exposing pards stopper). <br /> <br />Not only is your knowledge of 2/1 bidding tested, but so is your judgement.  There may be 2 roughly equal bids available, and the author will explain why one is slightly better than the other. <br /> <br />The way to get the most out of the book is to keep a record of quizzes you got wrong, then come back to the book in 6 months and see how you do. <br /> <br />Note:  This book uses Mike Lawrences version of 2/1 not Max Hardys, so there are a few differences.	2005-10-14

In terms of programming concepts and OOP design for financial engineering, this book has no equals. We have Daniel Duffy's Financial Instrument Pricing Using C++, but it takes a different approach (i.e. generic programming based in STL). All through the book, the author introduces improvements sequentially and doesn't start from the best design from the outset in order to demonstrate the flaws of a less general/useful/reusable program. In this sense, this is mainly a conceptual book, not an example book. For example, it deals with and develops vanilla-option pricing using Monte Carlo simulation over the first five chapters. A reader looking for a cookbook that gives programs to implement a large number of financial-derivative models would be well-advised to look elsewhere (e.g. Justin London's Modeling Derivatives in C++). However, someone looking for OOP wisdom would be generously rewarded for buying this book.	2005-10-14

It's a story of his two-month stay in Pyongyang while overseeing the production of a popular French children's cartoon. Delisle is not lost on the sad irony of his position, and tells his story simply and without pretense.<br /><br />The book deals mainly with how frustrating life is in the capital, even for a privileged foreigner like him: bad food, constant surveillance, blaring propanda songs, etc.<br /><br />It's probably most affecting when you get a real sense of the inner lives of his guide and translator. Both are very buttoned-up, proper and repressed. At one point Delisle lends one of them his copy of \\"1984\\"; when the guy returns it a week later he seems very nervous and mutters something about how he \\"doesn't like science fiction.\\" On the other hand, he rejoices when he gets a bottle of Hennessy as a going-away present.<br /><br />In the most terrifying episode Delisle asks his guide where all the handicapped people are in Pyongyang, and the guide responds that there aren't any handicapped people in North Korea. Yikes!<br /><br />Highly recommended to any fan of first-person graphic journalism.	2005-10-14

I had to have it when I first saw it in Border's bookstore. I ran out to Michael's Craft store that night and loaded up on Wilton \\"candy melts\\".  The decorated cakes in this book are fabulous.  They are not your ordinary buttercream rose cakes that are a single uniform color.  They are not formal fondant covered structures. They are...well..whimsical - that is the perfect word for these cakes.  They are bright and fun and bold and artistic, delicious and just plain amazing.  But I must admit, the melted chocolate decorations are not as easy as they appear in the book's instructions.  I'm not at all a beginner baker but this is the first time I've made \\"art\\" with melted chocolate and mine did not look so good. I've only tried it twice though and I am going to keep trying. Hopefully I will improve. The chocolate designs in this book are the dream results I strive for.  I've sat and read this book cover to cover about 4 times now.  I'm obsessed! The tiered cakes that she designs can have 2 or 3 completely different patterns or colors in the same cake. Sometimes each tier has a different pattern and color on each side. The colors are deep and are not commonly seen on cakes but on her cakes they look appropriate. Usually a cake decorating book concentrates on just the actual decorating part and the recipes are not that important to the author.  Not with this book. These recipes are excellent and easy.  Pretty basic flavors and instructions and very very good. I can't wait for the Christmas season when I can attempt to make that cute light blue snowman cake. The decorated cakes shown in this book would be fun to design but they just put ideas in your head for your own creations and you can just go wild with the possibilities!  I highly recommend this book!	2005-10-14

Navajo peacemaking has earned renown as a \\"horizontal system of justice\\", in which all participants are treated as equals with the foremost mission of preserving ongoing relationships and restoring harmony. There is no coercion, no \\"sides\\", no labels of plaintiff or defendant. Essays discuss the history of Navajo peacemaking, its concepts and practices, assessments of the model, and conclusions as to what can be learned from this system of justice. Especially recommended for legal philosophy shelves, as the ideas within contain the potential to reform and revolutionize flaws in modern mainstream culture dispute resolution systems, whether on a governmental or private level.	2005-10-14

I have little interest in or knowledge of designer clothes or the fashion world, and I don't subscribe to or read any fashion magazines.  That was exactly why I passed by this book several times before finally picking it up this weekend.  I thought it was going to be some story with a character I couldn't possibly relate to-- someone steeped in fashion who only cared about appearance.   <br /> <br />When I read the first few pages with Andrea IN the designer clothes, I thought I was right... but to my pleasant surprise, the main character turned out to be someone I could relate to and respect.  As a recent college graduate, I know from personal experience that the prospect of finding a job... getting a job... and trying to figure out a career are incredibly common to anyone in the relative age range of 21-24.  It's no easy task to deal with a first \\"real\\" job and the trials it provides while keeping an eye out for what comes next, because, inevitably, there will be a next.  No one stays in their first, entry-level, junky job, but this is a perfect read for the people who ARE in their first, entry-level, junky jobs. <br /> <br />What I found most impressive about this book is the way that, just like Andrea gets sucked into the lifestyle surrounding her job, the reader gets sucked into her goals for the future and how the job will get here there.  Towards the end, even as you realize it's wrong, it's so easy to rationalize (along with Andrea) that this is what she needs to do to secure her future; that she only has a few more weeks left-- all the while knowing deep down that, really, it's totally ridiculous.   <br /> <br />If you've ever had or have a boss who drives you insane for any reason, this is a great book to read because it will show you that your boss is a picnic in the park.  Well worth the read.	2005-10-14

This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to grow spiritually, who wants to live a conscious and compassionate life, and who wants to contribute to world peace. I have read many books on the topic of vegetarianism, animal rights and animal welfare,  spiritual growth, and peace and nonviolence. This book stands alone in its ability to make the connection between all of these subjects. <br /> <br />Will Tuttle, Ph.D. is a rare combination of extraordinary compassion, scholarly research and education, spiritual commitment and wisdom, intuitive insights, and the courage to challenge a worldview which goes back 10,000 years <br />  <br />In this book, Tuttle explores humanity's relationship with the foods we eat.  He points out, very convincingly, that when humans began herding animals, it began to create a consciousness of exploitation which then spread to the control and domination of other humans, as well as animals.  So the roots of human's violence to humans are found in the practice of seeing animals as objects to exploit for our own purposes: for food, furs, labor, entertainment, \\"sport\\" and experimentation. The use of humans as slaves and the subjugation of women followed the subjugation and enslavement of animals. <br /> <br />One thing that sets this book apart from any of the others that describe the problems associated with a meat-based diet is the focus on the spiritual aspects of our diet.  When we take food into our bodies, we are also ingesting the energy contained in this food. Animals that are tortured and filled with terror and agony as they are killed are filled with this very negative energy.  When humans eat their flesh, we are also ingesting this fear and anger. This affects us deeply.  We cannot live with peace in our hearts as long as we are filling our bodies with the pain and suffering of other beings. <br />   <br />Tuttle helps us to see that none of us have actually chosen a diet based upon meat. Our mothers fed us meat from our infancy.As we got old enough to understand that we were eating animals, we were told that animals were put here for us to eat, so it was okay.  We didn't question this, any more than we questioned wearing clothes or taking baths. Thus, we absorbed the acceptance of exploitation of animals so naturally that we didn't know it was happening.  And being unconscious, it is hard to recognize the violence that is part of our everyday lives through the eating of animals.  Therefore, it is also hard to recognize how insensitive we have become to violence, because we have to protect ourselves from an awareness of the violence we are part of 3 times a day.   <br />  <br />This is a very important book for everyone who wants their lives to contribute to more peace in the world, rather than more suffering and violence.  <br />  <br />	2005-10-14

Hutton reveals how football was not quite the all-encompassing passion that most band members claim and that tales of a rabble-rousing youth were frequently exaggerated. <br /> <br />The gigantic impact of the Stone Roses, Madchester and Spike Island prompted Hutton to form the Rain with Guigsy, Bonehead and Tony McCarroll. Hutton recounts the early days of the band and shows how this period was vital to the development of the Oasis sound. And Chris tells how his friends unceremoniously dropped him from the band to make way for Liam and Noel Gallagher and describes what it was like to be left behind, watching the others change as they progressed from anonymity to stardom. <br /> <br />	2005-10-14

I had to suspend my contact with reality a little bit, but I truly enjoyed this book on CD.  There was one incredible mistake, however, from Ellie, the supposed art expert.  She made the comment that she could \\"shoot John the Baptist through the eye in the painting of the Last Supper.\\"  As any good art expert (or Roman Catholic) would know, St. John the Baptist was not in Da Vinci's Last Supper; he was executed before Jesus even began his public ministry. <br /> <br />Despite this glaring error, Patterson had many twists and turns that kept me listening to this CD.  Just when I thought I had the whole story figured out, the plot twisted just enough to throw me off.  The ending was somewhat contrived and unbelievable; it also seemed rushed compared to the rest of this novel.  Overall, however, I would recommend it.	2005-10-14

This is actually too soon for this review to be written -- I've only been pursuing the stretches (exercises) for a little over a month now.<br /><br />  On the plus side, I believe I can credit this book with helping me get through the last week or so -- in addition to a cold, I ended up dealing with back, leg, and shoulder problems after a day of tree cutting and trimming, another day of construction work on the house, and a third day of helping our grown children prepare their pool for winter storage, which included letting cold water run over my feet for two hours.  I've suffered from short hamstrings for most of my life, a condition that was finally diagnosed just last year, and any one of those days (besides the cold) would have previously put me in bed for at least a day.  The combination should have put me in hospital for at least four days.  Not to say that I didn't have problems, but thanks in part to techniques and stretches from Mr. Cooley's book, I managed to stay active and motile, and have now almost fully recovered.<br /><br />  To the negative, it could be that Mr. Cooley puts too much stock in his own discoveries, and he is certainly too used to working with people with already-developed athletic capabilities.<br /><br />  First, \\"too much stock in his own discoveries.\\"  The first section of the book describes how Bob Cooley survived a near-death experience, and how he came upon his stretching techniques while recovering for that experience.  I have not yet walked his path long enough to deliver a real judgement, but I suspect that part of the benefits he ascribes to his techniques is actually a normal part of his return trip from death's door.<br /><br />  This is not to say that there is no value in his stretching techniques, but rather that they may not be the \\"univeral fix-everything\\" he represents them to be.<br /><br />  The second negative is that I find his presentation better suited to those who are already developed athletically rather than the majority of us who are somewhat motion impared.  By his own statement, Mr. Cooley discovered his first stretching techniques while attempting a middling-advanced yoga position. His book also includes testimonies from several world-class athletes, which I certainly would not dispute.  However, I had to invent several \\"remedial\\" stretches before even attempting the beginning series of stretches presented in his book (fortunately I have some theraputic streching and hatha yoga in my background), and a few of the illustrations for the beginning stretches seem misleading if not plain wrong.  The intermediate and advanced series appear to be correct, as far as I can currently tell.<br /><br />  Mr. Cooley's basic premise is that first, streching is good and second, stretching against resistance is better.  Theroretically this makes sense, since then all the cells in a muscle would elongate rather than just those involved at the muscle's maximum extension.  Also, \\"resistence stretching\\" is very similar to what most of us do naturally just before or after arising from bed.  However, as noted in the book, the \\"immediate strength\\" of a muscle will decline if only his stretching techniques are used.  Again this makes sense -- from my observation, the existing strength of a muscle becomes \\"spread\\" over the entire range of motion for that muscle, and as the muscle cells and fibers elongate, the \\"new\\" portion of them is weak until strengthened through other forms of exercise.  In fairness, the book points out that the stretches can be turned into strength building exercises by reversing their direction, but the follow-through on this concept is weak.<br /><br />  I don't feel qualified to comment on whether his claimed connection between his exercise cycles and the \\"meridians\\" of traditional Chinese medicine is valid.  I do know that, while many of his positions approximate those of hatha yoga, the muscle groups involved don't necessarily correspond -- for example, the \\"child\\" position in both yoga and western rehabilitation therapy focuses on the lower back and Mr. Cooley uses it to stretch the upper back, shoulders and arms.  Not necessarily wrong, mind you, but a much different emphasis.  Also, the beginning series doesn't quite involve ALL of the muscle groups, at least as I understand them.<br /><br />  In summary:  The book's main feature is \\"resistance stretching\\" (which might also be described as isometrics in motion).  While not the universal panacea it's presented to be, the concept IS quite useful and beneficial. It should be used in addition to other exercise techniques, not as a replacement for them, and Mr. Cooley would do well to include a set of remedial \\"absolute beginner\\" stretches for the less athletic among us.  Meanwhile, I'm glad I got the book, and I intend to keep doing the stretches.	2005-10-14

If this isn't horrifying enough, she finds out she is pregnant. Claire and her husband, Dan, have two children, a daughter, Katie, twelve, and a son, Spencer, seven. Both children came to the marriage after many miscarriages. That Claire would become pregnant after rape is against all odds. If there is such a thing as a blessing in a situation like this, the fact Claire can't remember the assault is a gift from God.<br /><br />This novel delves into the inner feelings of each of the family members as they decide what to do with the baby. Katie is old enough to understand how the baby came to be, but she doesn't want her parents to give it up. Spencer is too young to realize anything except his mom's belly is growing. Dan decides he can't love this child and because of this, Claire agrees to put the child up for adoption. The word goes out and a childless missionary couple is picked to adopt the baby, now known to be a girl.<br /><br />They come to meet the Holland family. Mixed feelings tear Claire apart. She loves her baby, but she doesn't want her raised in a home without a father who truly loves her. Katie can't understand why they can't keep the baby. But, bravely, she hands the little girl over to Rosemary and Ed the day the baby and Claire are released from the hospital. Years go by. The Holland family doesn't speak of the baby named Lara. They move to another town where Dan, a veterinarian, sinks his teeth into a new practice. Claire opens a bookstore. Katie and Spencer grow up, do all the things kids do, but Claire never forgets her daughter. She prays for her constantly. Unbeknownst to Claire, Katie, now called Kate and married with children of her own, wonders what has become of her sister. One day, while Claire is away at a business conference, a letter comes from Rosemary. Kate doesn't trust her mother to share it with her, so she opens it. Rosemary is dying of cancer. She wants the Holland family to raise Lara, now sixteen.<br /><br />This book is a study in human emotions I found hard to put down.

I tried the exercises for headache, neck pain and lower back pain, and after doing all of them, the pain was less for about 30 seconds and then I still had the pain I began with. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that anyone can get instant relief any way at all when having this kind of pain, otherwise the pharmaceutical companies would not be getting the billions of dollars a year that they get. I should think that most people would realize that for exercise to be effective a continual regular exercise program has to be developed under the care of a physical therapist or doctor.  <br /> <br />The only way these exercises may give some relief right away would be for the kind of pain that you get occasionally when you slept wrong, or for the odd kink that mysteriously appeared, and then for only the mildest pain imaginable. But for anyone with any kind of chronic pain, or pain due to years of bad posture or computer use, this title is very MISLEADING! I don't think instant pain relief in these circumstances is possible the way the author says. At least they didn't work for me. <br /> <br />However, the exercises probably would be excellent for longterm use and for prevention of some of these issues, and therein lies the positive aspect of the book. I would recommend getting it at the library first and if you are satisfied, then buy it.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Most of the reviewers spend time (and, undoubtedly their personal biases) on extraneous portions of this work.  The message is \\"We are in mortal danger\\". <br /> <br />Why?  Because Islam is on-the-march!!!  Even Mr. Blankly underplays the dangers when he mentions (on page.42) the five pillars of Islam (Prayer, fasting, almsgiving, profession of faith and pilgimage) in the context that jihad is not one of them such that it is not important to muslims.  (Indeed, according to Robert Spencer, Alvin Schmidt, Paul Sperry, Amir and Ergun Caner there are multiple places in the Koran calling for jihad.) <br />If anyone imagines that jihad is not part and parcel of Islam, consider:  When Mohammed finally succeeded in Medina he killed those not part of his group. When he went from there to Mecca, he killed.  And, after his death, the Arab hordes rose up out of the peninsula to spread Islam, killing, into the green crescent, Asia Minor, North Africa, Spain, southern France, eastward and to the very gates of Vienna - killing, killing, killing.  If anyone thinks for one minute that Islam is not a viscious power, they do so at their own peril.  Simply look at muslim behavior and listen to what they say.  Yes, there are peaceful muslims - those who don't read the \\"Book\\" and those whose own sense of humanity somehow overrides that which they are supposed to believe. <br /> <br />This book is a must read for our national leaders and all who are in a position to defend our culture and our nation. <br /> <br />Mark A.

I almost didn't buy it because I thought It would be too difficult to drag myself through all of the game specific terminology since I don't play the game. I was WRONG. Dan Abnett truly tells a compelling, in-depth, page turner of a story that's 1 part Sherlock Holmes, 1 part Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1 part Lovecraft's Cthulu. The Eisenhorn Ominbus edition covers all three books and 2 chronlogically organized short stories.   <br /> <br />Inquisitor Eisenhorn is truly a character you can invest in and his tragic flaws only make more him more endearing and believable. This is not a superhero, James Bond series where the main characters always save the day and emerge unscathed. These stories are really about Eisenhorn's transformation as he is drawn deeper and deeper into crossing the line of heresy in his crusade to save humanity from the terrors of Chaos. How much sacrifice is acceptable and can the ends justify the means? The beauty of this SF epic is that Eisenhorn explores these concepts while providing a blood-soaked, action packed, thriler of a ride.  <br /> <br />I just chucked Dune and Starhship Troopers off my bookshelf. Eisenhorn deserves to stand alone at the top of the SF heap. My best comparison is LOTR. This is a definite buy-it-in-hardback-if-you-can-find-it so it can endure the wear of re-reading.	2005-10-13

While balanced perspectives are available to those proficient enough to wade through the stormy seas of coverage, much of the reporting obsesses on the drawbacks and any failed efforts of the US military and its allies.  <br /> It is a very good thing that such myriad media did not exist in 1776.  In David McCullough's engaging rendering of America's birth, he exposes the many setbacks, missteps, defeats, desertions, and poorly planned or executed campaigns that plagued the nascent nation's ragged army. Had CNN existed in those days, a colonial version of Judy Woodruff could regularly regale viewers with leading statements such as \\"more and more of General Washington's supporters are growing disillusioned with his poor management and indeciveness.\\"   An 18th century Al Franken could have gone on Air America (a.k.a. Err America) and maligned the American military for declaring war on a sovereign country that posed it no threat.  And an equally vacuous, previous incarnation of Arianna Huffington would have had reason to have elite loyalists malign Washington and company on a reality-blurring blog had such technology been around during the Revolution. <br /> McCullough does document the miscalculations America's inexperienced military committed as well as list the many triumphs of the established and potent British forces.  He expounds upon the doubts many of Washington's contemporaries privately and sometimes publicly expressed.  Before the sober judgment of history could objectively evaluate the transfiguring legacy of Washington's accomplishments, the uncertainty of the present did give jusifiable cause to those who questioned his wisdom and strategy.   The eventual success of the ragtag colonial army-despite massive desertions-and the enduring American experiment prove the mastery of Washington's prowess and show why his name has become synonymous with greatness. The Father of his Country would not have earned his rightful place in history had he failed to remain steadfast when the going got tough or adroitly recovered from the inevitable mistakes that befall all battlefield planning. <br /> \\"1776\\" fleshes out a timeless story and shows that there were many difficulties and heartaches that preceded the ultimate victory.  It also serves as a good inspiration for the ongoing liberation of Iraq.  Had the clichs of \\"quagmire\\" and \\"another Vietnam\\" existed in the 1700's no doubt the ancestors of today's antiwar ilk would have routinely invoked them.  As this readable work clearly spells out, war is a messy proposition where the best laid plans can and do go astray, but setbacks can never excuse retreat.  A far stronger case could have been made for abandoning the mission in 1776 than modern day Iraq.  Years from now both will stand as American military victories, and the bumps along the road to success will be reduced to historic footnotes.  <br />	2005-10-13

For example, in some contexts he'll use the word \\"universe\\" as meaning physical spacetime, and in other contexts he'll use it to mean \\"everything that exists, including God.\\" Initially, he tells you when he's changing his meaning, but then he later doesn't.<br /><br />In short, if you are used to the clarity and rigorous approach used by many philosophical authors (e.g., Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, etc.), then you may find Ward's approach a bit less deductive (or even inductive). He is mostly concerned with rebutting Dawkins and Atkins than actually developing an original philosophy.<br /><br />For instance, he develops many interesting metaphysical ideas (for example, human free will is not incompatible with God's omniscience, since God could conceivably know of every *possible universe* while the future of the *actual universe* was indetermined), but he doesn't lay down a rigorous metaphysical system. I suppose one reason he does this is because he wants to appeal to a wide crowd of religious people who have their own doctrines, and they might feel alienated if Ward was to make truth claims beyond what is universally accepted about how the universe works.<br /><br />Not clearly a good thing, he often waxes lyrical in poetic tangents that don't do much to help his case, except maybe emotionally or aesthetically. Though, I suppose if intuition and aesthetics are any basis for concluding something about reality, then these tangents aren't entirely wasteful. Oh, and for some reason he frequently employs awkward transitional adverbs to begin sentences like, \\"In fact, of course, it is true that...,\\" which I found distracting.<br /><br />I think this book's greatest success is in highlighting the grave limitations of natural selection *alone* to explain intelligent life. He effectively proves that the idea of life existing for the propagation of genes (Cf. Dawkins, \\"The Selfish Gene\\") is completely ludicrous (it would be, he points out, like suggesting that the cake exists for the propagation of the recipe; but the recipe does not have intention, and neither does DNA!). Again, these are not couched in philosophical language, and, if you want a more rigorous approach that supports Ward's position, I recommend you see any of John Searle's essays or books about consciousness.ighlighting the grave limitations of natural selection *alone* to explain intelligent life.

I found this volume to be extremely interesting, even fascinating at times.  It focuses upon the writing of Winston Churchill's epic \\"The Second World War,\\" whose six volumes were a major publishing event around the world, and eventually earned Churchill a Nobel Prize for literature. It is really several different books in one. <br /> <br />    First, much like Ashley's \\"Churchill as Historian,\\" the author discusses the actual mechanics of writing so massive a project when Churchill had plenty of other things to keep him busy.  The \\"syndicate\\" of experts who assisted him, including even the Parliamentary Cabinet Office, is analyzed in great detail. According to the author, the \\"three D's\\" were the core of Churchill's method.  That is, first he had set in type the key documents which he had collected during his wartime service as Prime Minister. Then he tied the documents together with dictated reminiscenses.  Finally, the third \\"D\\" consisted of a very large number of drafts whereby the documents were edited down and the connecting narrative supplemented with WC's own recollections or papers drafted by syndicate members. Ironically, it is Churchill's heavy reliance upon documents that at once has yielded much praise from other historical researchers (since otherwise they would not have been made public for as much as 50 years after the war's conclusion),but also generated negative reactions from lay readers, especially in the U.S. <br /> <br />     Next, the really interesting issues are tackled.  For example, how candid and accurate was WC regarding his actions during the war?  The author extremely well documents how WC would edit documents, or even modify them, in order to (not surprisingly) put himself in the best historical light.  Also, he was duty bound not to reveal the existence of \\"Ultra,\\" which was the designation for breaking the German code during the war. Given the fact that in the postwar period, others were also writing books (e.g., Ike with his \\"Crusade in Europe\\" and Sherwood's \\"Roosevelt and Hopkins\\"), WC would frequently modify his drafts in order to obviate any possible taint regarding his decisions and actions while PM in a stab at vindication.  One good example was the dispute that arose over whether WC had favored or retarded the \\"Overlord\\" invasion of France in 1944. Churchill also faced the practical constraints of the Cold War being on-going and also acting as head of the Conservative Party and ultimately PM for a second time.  These factors too influenced how he structured the text. <br /> <br />     Of course a most intriguing question is did WC really write the work given the extensive assistance he received?  The author suggests a useful analogy: WC was like a master chef at a large restaurant who designs and directs the menu, while others do much of the actual food preparation.  He also likens it to a group project in science, where a number of folks collaborate on a paper which is attributed to the lead author. Clearly, it is Churchill's book even though he did not write all of it himself--but he reviewed every sentence and corrected or struck out that with which he disagreed.  <br /> <br />    Finally, in a most interesting discussion, the author recounts the arguments that arose during the 1955-1965 period as other historians, military figures, and the leaders of other countries (such as De Gaulle) took aim on Churchill's analysis.  Not quite as challenging as fighting Hitler, but still quite a nice war of its own.  The author, Professor of International History at Cambridge, has done just a superior job.  Be warned, it is a long book (over 600 pages) and the Penguin edition is set in very small type.  But the rewards of the book more than compensate for these problems, especially for those of us interested in Churchill. The stream of Churchill volumes continues unabated and has even increased recently--but this book should be singled out for the unique perspective it affords us on \\"the great man.\\"	2005-10-13

The main character Jack Paris a homicide detective on a scarce string of murder cases. The murders are vicious acts of crime and have nothing in common except for a small symbol found on the victims. However as the novel progresses Jack realizes that the murders have something to do with the murder of a cop and friend that occurred two years earlier.  <br /> <br />Richard Montanari's style consists of gruesome yet unique murders. Combing flashbacks with present writing. As well as, switching between the points of views from Jack Paris, and the murderers. Looking At things form the murders point of view and seeing them happen then transfers to Jack Paris where the reader sees things, as they are unraveled. These transformations keep the reader intrigued and wanting to continue to reed.  Montanari introduces many different kinds of human torture and unique techniques to slaughter people. The chapters are plentiful and short, so that it moves quickly and the reader won't want to put the book down when reading. This is a great novel of suspense.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

I've been a big Red Sox and Johnny Damon fan for a long time. Now, I don't think so much of Johnny. I figured, with the book being billed as a narrative on his baseball life, that it would be very biographical--what happened to him throughout his life. As others have said, he certainly did not fail to highlight the amazing ballplayer he saw in himself. He genuinely thinks very highly of himself. It was quite shocking. The one part that really brought me over the edge of not liking the book so much was when he talked about how he should have made the All-Star team, but Joe Torre never picked him. At one point, he also says that he had a chance to be named the 30th man to the All-Star roster, but Ichiro's fans in Japan got on the internet and voted. I can certainly understand those feelings if they were coming from a fan. Like I said, I really loved the image of Johnny Damon I knew before.

Although his writing is very simple and somewhat predictable, he tells a good story. For those who enjoy romances in foreign settings, touched with a bit of adventure, here's a book you can get into pretty quickly. It opens with a man and his daughter (unnamed characters) on a tour in the jungles of Peru to help out with the poor. During this trip, the man encounters Paul Cook, who then proceeds to tell his story. <br /> <br />Paul's story begins on Christmas Eve in the ER back in the United States. He's on duty that night and thinks he could have saved his two main patients, but unfortunately they do not make it. One is a young boy who had a tiny toy soldier lodged in his throat. The other is a middle-aged man who had a heart attack. Following the end of this scene, the story moves on to Christine, who has just been dumped by her fianc a week before their wedding. She is devastated and cannot understand why this is happening to her. All her life she has dreamed of her wedding day, and now it's not even going to happen. <br /> <br />Best friend Jessica tries to cheer Christine up by taking them both on a trip to Peru for a tour that will allow them to work with the poor, helping the villagers while also learning about the native jungles and what it is like to live there. Despite Christine's protests, they end up in Machu Picchu anyway. Christine is a city girl and is very high-maintenance. She does not do well at all during the initial part of their trip, complaining nonstop. But on her first day in the village, she bumps into a man, Paul Cook, not realizing that it's his orphanage they will be helping out during their stay in Peru. <br /> <br />While Evans's writing is rather simplistic in nature, the focus is the story and the characters he creates. He paints an exciting and exotic portrait of the jungles of Peru, and the reader will be able to imagine the life these people lead. PaulCook left the States to devote his time to these poverty-stricken children, and while he seems very content, it is Christine who awakens something in him. He's almost ready to ask her to commit to a relationship, despite the fact that he lives in poverty and has nothing to offer her except his love. <br /> <br />Christine starts off as a very high-maintenance prima donna who I didn't care for, but Peru changes her and helps her grow up. Working with the poor also helps her forget Martin, the fianc who abandoned her a week before their wedding. I found Jessica to be rather irritating as she seems to be the exact opposite of Christine. While Christine is rigid and follows the rules, Jessica is very free-spirited and blase about her relationships with men. The casual affair means nothing to her but fun and excitement. Christine needs something more than just fast sex and a roll in the hay. She is touched by Paul's devotion to the villagers, admires him, and finds him to be very attractive. While Christine and Paul get to know each other as friends, Jessica also meets a man who may change her life --- or maybe he will pass through her life before she meets yet another eligible bachelor. Her actions, however, endanger her life and the lives of others, as readers will find out. <br /> <br />THE SUNFLOWER is what I like to call a comfort read, a simply written love story that is clean and almost old-fashioned in its contents. This is the story of two people who meet by chance and whose lives are changed forever because of it. Recommended. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton (Ratmammy@lofton.org) <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Very few. So when I saw the Times review a while back, along with a recommendation from my closest friend, I had a mixture of trepidation and curiosity.  The one exception to this \\"run screaming in the other direction\\" reaction has been this highly imaginative and riveting work by Jackson McCrae.  It's hard to go into things here as far as plot, characters, tie-ins, etc. as so many others have done that and you can see for yourself that many people love this work.   <br /> <br />One of the themes of this book is that of redemption through forgiveness. But the path is not easy and McCrae does make us work through the process, just as he had to.  Short story chapters of his life alternate with present day New York job stress and remembrances.  These two \\"styles\\" and chapter-types play off one another until they build to an incredibly emotional and devestating climax.  When you do get to the climax of the novel, be prepared. You will need to stop, put the book down, and pick your jaw up off the floor.  I guarantee you that you've never read anything as shocking as this one chapter. Someone once said that there is nothing new under the sun. I've alway believed that---until I read this book.  The horrific incident that fuels the writer's quest to find out what happened to him as a child is so totally devestating that you'll be in shock for weeks.  Graphic? Oh, yes. Not for the squeamish either.  But it works perfectly and after that, all the stories that came before it make perfect sense.  It's as if this novel is one big puzzle and McCrae is putting it together for you, one piece at a time.  When he does finally give you the last piece, you fall back, amazed that you didn't see it coming.    <br /> <br />Built from the ground up, this literary masterpiece is far beyond anything out on the book market today.  If you read the many reviews you'll seethat there are references upon references to Capote.  While this is indeed correct, it's only a \\"jumping off\\" point and not meant to be an exact replica of that author's style or thought process.  It's as if the writer \\"in the book\\" is enamored with Mr. C and can't help himself. But this is really only a small portion of this great and well-built novel. Forget all this---the metaphors, the layers, the tie-ins to Keller, Capote, and any and every other literary tricks the author is capable of----and his technique is admirable, even genius.  But this is, above all, a story from the heart.  It's about people connecting.  It's about finding out who you are.  It's about life's experiences, good and bad.  It's about the horrible things people do to each other.  And it's about the goodness in people.  This novel is life itself.   <br /> <br />It's been said that everyone has a story to tell.  Trust me-no one has one quite like this.  There's something about the settings, the timing, the brave human acts of kindness, that could not be replicated anywhere, anytime, at any other place in the world.  McCrae has taken the very center of the Civil Rights movement and used it as a character itself.  Couple this with the heroics of the African-American housekeeper and you've got a formula for success.  Which is exactly what this book is----success. For those who get what the author is trying to do, please pass this along to a friend.  This book is based on a true story, and only a small portion of names and places have been changed. That the author was able to bare his soul and laugh at certain incidents only reinforces the idea of survival.  And what a survivor he must be----he lived to write this no-holds-barred experience of his life---obviously in the hope that it would be an inspiration to others.  I know, for it inspired me.  Something this great, this perfect, and this human only comes along once in a lifetime.  Grab it while you can. You're in the presence of genius---pure, simple . . . genius. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

This one is, I hate to say it, worse, but for diffrent reasons. <br /> <br />A 55 year old woman is raped and then rescued by her husband. His first thought is to have sex with her in case she's fallen pregnant by her attackers. She seems to think this is a good idea. How offensive is this? Let me count the ways. <br /> <br />Rape isn't about sex, first of all. It's about violence. Jamie doesn't understand that, which might be expected given his time and place, but you'd think Claire would set him straight. You'd also think that her general health and state of mind would be more important to him than any worries about pregnancy. In a purely biological sense, I assume Claire is not exempt from menopause just because she time travels.  Most of all I just can't accept the idea of her being raped, and then being interested in sex with a husband who is so callous and self centered. If that is true to Jamie's character, I don't like what he's become. <br /> <br />Also, I can't believe I'm the only person disturbed by the general homophobia.   Claire suggests that John Gray is interested in Jamie's son because of the resemblance. This is a stereotype more destructive than most, that gay men are all interested in young boys. I had to read the passage a couple times before I could believe what I was reading. If that is true to Clair's character, I don't like what she's become. <br /> <br />In short, I don't like what has become of any of the characters or the series as a whole, and I'm saddened by the decline of the story.	2005-10-13

Douglas Adams in his one of his possibly best know books really out did himself. In this adventure a boring simpleton named Arthur Dent living on the planet we call earth has befriended a guy named Ford Perfect, who is not as he claimed from earth but from a planet called Betelgeuse. Where he was sent from to do research for \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Universe\\" (it's a book where it has everything and anything that you could possibly need to know about the universe). Ford tells Arthur that he isn't from around here.  He isn't from Earth. In telling Arthur this he also tells him that the earth is about to end.  <br /> And since they have gotten to be really close friends he takes Arthur with him when he hitches a ride with the Vogan ships (these are what the aliens are called that destroyed our planet earth). Vogan's in particular don't like hitchhikers very much. So they kick them off the ship, shortly after they get on. And by pure chance they get picked up. And the story goes from there. <br /> Now that I've told you how the book starts I'll leave it up to you to read the rest of the book. And if you read this book, then watch the movie. You'll see that the movie is hardly based on this incredible book .	2005-10-13

I developed this interest in my early teens at a time when the country I was living in was going through massive changes. One of the things I learned during this time was that the truth is often hard to come by when studying history particularly when you are living it. What I thought was truth turned out not to be so true and at the same time lies abounded from the other side. When it comes to the life of Nelson I have read much and although my interest today is still the Victory I decided to find a decent biography of Nelson to add to my library. Roger Knight has, in my opinion, told the truth about Nelson in the most complete way I have ever come across in a very easy to read style and backed up by a prolific bibliography. Two thirds of the book is the biography of Nelson and the rest consists of a chronology of Nelson's life, notes on the people in his life, notes about the ships he sailed in and a glossary. Roger Knight dispels some of the myths that have grown up about Nelson but does not detract from the outstanding leader of men that Nelson was. Nelson's failings are not glossed over in favor of his greatness as some have tended to do. Knight has not belittled Nelson to the point of saying that the battle of Trafalgar was nearly lost because of his vanity. Nelson was human like the rest of us, and this book shows the life of a true leader who overcame his weaknesses be they moral, personal or physical to rise above the norm and excel. This book was written to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar and is, as far as I am concerned, the most balanced story of the life of Nelson there is.	2005-10-13

US	14898173	RXEYMUO0G84G4	067082982X	877287899	The Dark Half	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Pat's review - great book	A novel about the struggle between a man and his \\"dark half.\\" Writer, Thad Beaumont, decides it's time he puts a rest to his pen name \\"George Stark.\\" In a strange series of events, you find out that George Stark has come to life. The story alternates between George's view and Thad's view throughout their struggle to destroy each other. <br /> <br />This book, for me at least, was for the most part not too difficult a read. Stephen King has great diction. Some of the words he uses to describe things are extremely effective. These words give the book that extra edge in creating a suspenseful (and often times gruesome) situation. The novel is also one that you don't want to put down. In fact, in the prologue starts you with a little taste of what is to come in the rest of the book. In those first 10 pages you just know that you have to find out what it has to do with the story. You must be warned though, this book is not for those who are faint of heart or have a weak stomach, it's quite graphic. Another interesting thing King does is he splits up the book not only into chapters but also what could be considered two \\"acts.\\" Before and after each act are parts from the stories that the characters in the book have written. This really gives you a good sense of the contrast between the characters and how each of their minds work. Also, once you get a little ways into the book you are now working with two points of view, that of Thad and that of George. This again gives you a great sense of what is going on. Once the two characters are both introduced into the book they are far apart. As the story progresses they gradually come together and their stories meet. Stephen King has an impeccable ability to keep you interested in what will happen next, even in the down time when nothing thrilling is happening.	2005-10-13

I like to consider myself an informed individual, especially when it comes to world paradigm-shifting concepts such as the globalization of free markets.  So you can imagine my delight when I came upon the latest book by Mr. Friedman purporting to discuss this and many other economically and socially important issues. <br /> <br />But I found myself so dumbstruck by the title that I only managed to stare at the book's cover for what seemed a small eternity.  The world is flat?  Maybe on very small scales.  I mean, Euclid showed us that we can approximate a plane on a curved surface, provided we limit ourselves to a very small fraction of that surface, equivalent, say, to Topeka.  I'm not talking the whole state of Kansas either, but just Topeka.  Last time I checked, Topeka was not the whole world.  Just to make sure, I hopped on a plane to China, and yes, China is not in Kansas, much less Topeka. <br /> <br />Now Mr. Friedman is an obviously intelligent guy, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and set out on my sailboat to the edge of the world.  Unlike the nautical maps of old, current maps do not have, at their borders, the inscription, \\"Here there be monsters.\\"  Nonetheless, I sailed out to the edge of the map I had and very nearly sailed off the edge of the world.  Friedman was right!  The water just stops at the edge of the earth!  The horizon past the edge was a soul-sucking blackness that chilled my spine.  I screwed up my nerve and peered over the edge into a bottomless abyss of more blackness.  Right then I vowed never to doubt Mr. Friedman ever again. <br /> <br />I have had time to ponder the import of Mr. Friedman's message and its implication for our place in the Universe, but every time I think upon it, the memory of that yawning blackness at the edge of our world threatens to swallow up my limited consciousness and I can proceed no further.  My days of intrepid exploration are at end, and I leave it to others, such as Mr. Friedman, to continue togo where others dare not.	2005-10-13

There is no analysis, not really much argument at all. Simply repeating that the Nazis were ruthless, sometimes using that word six times on one page, is not an argument. Nor is it news.

This is the long-awaited second edition of Fletcher & Rossing.  Note first that it really is a reference work, not a teaching text.  There is no lesson plan, no problems, no solutions manual, no accompanying workbook  Except for the first two foundation sections on vibrating systems and sound waves, there is no ongoing development.  Nothing builds.  It's just one topic piled on another.   <br />       But the great merit of reference works is that you can cherry-pick, i.e. seek information on isolated topics with little concern for what preceded them.  As a reference work, F&R get the highest possible marks from me.  They are clearly the masters of this field, not least because of their numerous important contributions to it.  With the possible exception of the works of Arthur Benade, they own the business.   <br />       Despite its enormous size and great depth of coverage, however, it is not an encyclopedic study of musical instruments.  It is exactly what the title says: a work on the PHYSICS of musical instruments.  A rigid boundary has been drawn between physics and every other aspect of music-making.  In particular, psychoacoustics is totally ignored.  There are no entries in the index under loudness, Fletcher-Munson, combination tones, false bass, consonance, dissonance, etc.  Even equal temperament tuning gets little more than one page out of 756. <br />       The Preface says the work is addressed to \\"the reader...who is not frightened by a little mathematics.\\"  Well, some of the math is \\"little\\" but some of it is not.  See for example the use of Green's functions to find the air load on a vibrating membrane, pp. 588-590.  Perhaps at MIT, where incoming freshman are sorted out by the do-or-die killer course in mathematical physics from Morse & Feshbach, these methods are taught to undergrads, but not at most other schools.  Almost everywhere else this would be considered first-year graduate material.  These pages would not only frighten the averagereader; they frighten me.  I always hated Green's functions and considered it part of my mission in life to prune them away wherever they grew. <br />     There are a few typos, mislabeled equations and the like.  The next-to-last sentence of text on p. 232 says, \\"This is an adquate approximation provided the sound wavelength is small compared to the transverse dimensions of the ducts and cavities involved.\\"  Surely \\"small\\" should read \\"large.\\" <br />       In sum, not for beginners, and probably not for most musicians either.  But within its compass it reigns supreme.  There is no better book in this field.     <br />  <br />	2005-10-13

Whether you're an avid or new reader of IR romances this book is a great read.     The Bad:   1) The characters are A-typical or IR romances. Yvonne, the antagonist,is an emotionally broken, however, financially successful black woman who's been hurt in past realtionships. She meets the A-typical white male-also financailly successful, good looking, and also emotionally battered.     The Good:   1)While the characters are A-typical of IR romance novels, the characters have good depth. Each character displays a good range of feeling and emotions.   2)There romance is well written and develops over the story. You don't feel like they meet and immediately fall in love. It happens slowly and the author details it's development. The reader actually feels like they watched the relationship develop.  3)There is great sex. The sex scenes are steamy and slightly (well a little more than slightly) erotic. They are incredibly well written and form clear images for the reader.   4)Most importantly the race issue is handled incredibly well. The author deals with it without dwelling on it. Unlike some more expeirenced authors she doesn't allow the race issue to overwhelm the plot. The keeps the romance at the front of the story...which is refreshing.    Overall: This book was very well written and a great read. I don't have buyer's remorse and feel as thought it was worth all of the eight dollars I spent buying it (there is a reason there are very few used copies). This is an author to keep you eye on.	2005-10-13

I hope and pray that there is someone of that calibur regardless of party affiliation that will do the people's business in 2008(not his own).	2005-10-13

It's Love in Excess, it's Gulliver's Travels. It's not Gulliver's Travel's, it's Oroonoko. <br /> <br />Actually, the first novel is probably Gargantua and Pantagruel by Rabelais. Or Don Quixote. Either way, it's not in English. And when it comes down to it, it doesn't really matter. Love in Excess (and the others around it) should be judged on its own merit, not in chronological/\\"novelistic\\" relation to other supposed \\"first novels.\\" <br /> <br />So, judged on its own merit, is Love in Excess any good? <br /> <br />Well, first of all, it's highly theatrical, in multiple senses of the word. Eliza Haywood was a successful actress and the novel is dedicated to a big former stage star of the day. (It'd be like a book being dedicated to Julia Roberts today.) The novel is composed in three highly-differentiable parts - they seem like they could be three acts in a play. The characters are often easily placed into types - one could imagine one person playing three of characters of the same type (e.g., the deceitful woman) that each appear in a separate part/act. <br /> <br />Love in Excess is, fundamentally, about exactly that - what happens when too much \\"love\\" is shooting around everywhere. Love, lust - whatever. Haywood delves deeply into what love is, and it's a very different notion than what we have. <br /> <br />Probably few people today read Love in Excess for its plot, but the story is worth it - convoluted, ridiculous, at points hilarious, full of outrageous coincidences, trashy, and by the standards of the day surely damn near pornographic. The syntax takes a little getting used to, but the book flows well as it goes on. <br /> <br />The main fault of Love in Excess to the modern reader, though, is that it's not saucy *enough.* Compared with romance novels (that phrase was once oxymoronic, but I think it makes sense even in relation to Love in Excess) today, you're left with a bit of the \\"That's it?\\" feeling.  <br /> <br />(Still, by the standards of the day...)	2005-10-13

Dr. Poland takes great pains to explain the minor actions that influenced not only the armies, but the two nations as well.  <br />     The battles are descibed in detail and set the stage for the following years of war in the Eastern Theater.  Much of the information concerning western Virginia (present day West Virginia) is usually absent or diluted in most modern accounts. <br />     Dr. Poland also examines the press accounts of this period in the war and contrasts the sentiments of the public in the North and South.  The book is well footnoted and gives many examples of newspaper coverage.  This is especially enlightening in the current climate of news coverage. <br />     The division of the conflict into the four invasion corridors makes the information easier to follow and allows the reader to better visualize the conflict.  This is important because the information is sometimes tedious by the nature of detailed troop movements. <br />     While this book and its detailed description of minor, athough fierce, battles may not hold the interest of the young or casual reader, it is a must for any student or buff of the Civil War in Virginia.  It is also good for those generally interest in Virginia/West Virginia history.  Attention to detail is required to read this, but it is that amount of detail that makes it worth it. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-10-13
US	52849014	R2RM7NN38BSHN1	0940895072	365246507	Selling Satan: The Evangelical Media and the Mike Warnke Scandal	Books	5	29	31	N	N	Good Reading and Well-Researched	Unlike many of the reviews that I've read for this book, I read this book with an open mind. Even more than that, having personally been a Mike Warnke fan many years ago, I had noticed on my own that his stories do not line up. With that in mind, I sat down and sketched out many of the simple facts that do not add up. I encourage anyone with an interest in Mike Warnke to step past their own emotional responses and actually study Mike Warnke's words.<br /><br />For example, if you were to listen to all Mike Warnke's concert recordings and keep a journal of everything he claims, and then compare the notes from the individual recordings and the Satan Seller, you will quickly realize on your own that Mike's portrayal of his own life just is not possible. His story of his own life changes too greatly over time. Additionally, the timeline of events as Mike describes cannot be accomplished on a calendar. Although some errors can be attributed to the passage of time and the possibility that a fact or two can be misplaced, the staggering number of incongruities that occur in Mike's own words are just too many to be shrugged off. After amassing such list of apparent mistakes on your own as I have suggested, sit down and read this book. You will see that not only does your list make sense and Mike's life does not, but you will be able to fill in many of the causations and backgrounds for the inconsistencies.<br /><br />I find it amusing, however, that the people who are accusing the writers of this book of dishonesty are also stooping to name-calling, and at the same time degrading the book's authors and promoters as name-callers. That's like saying, \\"Stop calling me names, you pooh-pooh head!\\" I understand that there are a great number of people that loved Mike's public image in the past, and several people still do. This causes an emotional reaction to the truth, and that makes it almost impossible for some people to take. For example, most people have been around the Internet long enough at this point to have seen an Urban Legend or two. When you point out that someone has forwarded you an Urban Legend, there is an underlying realization by the sender that they have just been fooled. They become embarrassed, defensive, and sometimes deny the truth by trying to back up the story with allegations that the story was verified by other sources. There comes a time when you have to put aside your emotional reaction to a situation and just analyze the facts.<br /><br />I also find it interesting that one of the reviewers seems to base his assertion for Mike's innocence on a personal conversation that he had with Mike. Although I am not 100% sure, I feel that most people would be easily subdued by Mike if they spent an afternoon with him. That's part of Mike's recipe for success - his charisma is unmistakable. Like a skilled artist, Mike knows how to make you see \\"his\\" side of the story, regardless of any basis in fact.<br /><br />That being said, the accusation that Christians \\"shoot their wounded\\" is all-too-often true. If Mike had come forth and openly admitted that he had lied, asked forgiveness from those that he had offended, and the church still treated him as an outcast, then the church would be guilty of such a crime. But with Mike Warnke, the reverse is more the case. Mike has wronged a great number of people, and yet he still maintains his innocence and claims to be the victim. (The closest that Mike has come to admitting any wrong-doing on his part was to assert that he had exaggerated slightly.)<br /><br />From having studied human behavior, there is an explanation to Mike's actions. Mike's stories and defenses seem to put him more in the category of a Pathological Liar and not a Compulsive Liar. For those of you that have never met a Pathological Liar, they are interesting people to know. Compulsive Liars simply tell lies for personal gain or self-preservation. They are aware that they are lying, but they can justify their behavior patterns to themselves. (This behavior is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.) Pathological Liars, on the other hand, tell lies for a myriad of reasons, but believe their lies as deeply as we believe the truth. Therefore, they can defend their lies with a zeal that parallels the defense of truth. Having personally known a few Pathological Liars in my lifetime, it is frequently hard to distinguish their truths from their lies. Because of this predisposition to dishonesty, Pathological Liars often lose the trust of everyone around. And unless they make an attempt to regain trust, they may never be trusted again. Mike Warnke's conduct suggests that he is not concerned with regaining trust, because he continues to assert that he never lied, even when faced with insurmountable evidence to the contrary. Because of this, Mike's behavior can only be categorized as unrepentant.<br /><br />This leaves us with a few questions and answers:<br /><br />Should the church reject Mike Warnke? Absolutely not.<br />Should Mike Warnke be forgiven? Yes.<br />Should Mike Warnke repent? Yes.<br />If Mike does not repent, should he still be forgiven? Yes.<br /><br />But the most important question: If Mike does not repent, and we have forgiven him as the Bible instructs, should he still be trusted?<br /><br />That answer, I'm afraid, is NO.r is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.)

Krugman is the winner of the John Bates Clark medal in economics, the second highest economic award next to the Nobel Prize. The Clark medal is also considered by many to be harder to get than the Nobel because it's only given every two years. And yes, Krugman is considered a favorite to win the Nobel in the near future. The Economist, the world's preeminent economics magazine which has a self-admitted conservative bent, has called Krugman the most creative economist of his generation and has said he is the finest economist to become a media star since Milton Friedman and John Maynard Keynes. That's pretty heavy company. He has penned numerous scholarly book and articles as well as textbooks that are considered standard in higher economics classes worldwide. Those who call Krugman a hack or a liberal hatchetman are flat-out wrong, no matter what side of the political spectrum one is on. The only evidence that Krugman is a hack exists in the bent mind of a rabid conservative.  <br /> <br />Is he partisan? Well, that's a little tougher to pin down. He is certainly a liberal and this book relentlessly attacks the Bush administration. However, to say someone is partisan to me implies that they let their bias dictate their beliefs, rather than the facts, which is not the case here. Over and over, Krugman points out the differences between traditional conservative economic philosophy and the Bush administration's philosophy, which isto say, no recognizable or reputable economic philosophy. Hell, Krugman even served for a year on Reagan's council of economic advisers, and has written extensively on the ills of European-style socialism and the possible harms in limiting global markets. Remember too, that this is a selective collection of essays and columns over a period of four years, not a give-and-take narritive tome that takes on counter-analysis. <br /> <br />The question of whether or not the book is slanted really depends on your point of view. One thing is for certain, Krugman proves his case over and over again using non-partisan statistics and reasoning. The numbers he presents are not incorrect. He correctly points out how the Bush tax cuts, once fully realized with hidden provisions, will severly weaken the economic structure of America in terms of being able to support initiatives. He correctly points out in the article \\"Bad Heir Day\\" how the elimination of the estate tax will only benefit a very few mega-rich citizens, not small businesses and farmers. There is not a single article that has no basis in fact and irrefutable evidence. That is not partisan, that is fact. The writings are clear and are concise, and the limited space of a column does not stop him from presenting a strong case every time. <br /> <br />But the real question is one of point of view. Most people, myself included, would look at this book and be very troubled. But the people who will disagree with that assesment and therefore would not like this book would see what the Bush administration is doing and think it is good. They are starve-the-beasters. They would think that cutting all this money and destroying the system as we know it is good, because to them, it means the dissapearing of social programs because of a budget \\"crisis.\\" Supply-side economics is a joke, and has been regarded as such by most professional economists since its inception, but if you view the cutting of benefit programs and cutting taxes on the top 1 percent almost exclusively as positives, then you will most certainly disagree with Mr. Krugman.  <br /> <br />I hope and pray though, that people who do will be out of power soon.	2005-10-13

Obviously the work of a first-time author, CD Payne's Youth in Revolt uneasily lurches along a predictable path to a teenage nerd's ultimate fantasy ending.  Our protagonist, Nick Twisp, begins the story as a fairly standard Oakland dweeb, but in course of the book inexplicably transforms into some kind of clever, manipulative uber-genius sex god. Unfortunately, the transformation never comes across as believable.   <br /> <br />Part of the problem can be traced to the book's structure; Payne chose to write the stories in diary format.  Sometimes, though rarely, this method works for recounting tales.  In this case, Payne's insistence on using overblown vocabulary words makes the character's inner dialogue preposterous.  Nick's writing and speech reflect the voice of a 40 year old man.   <br /> <br />That his friends think and speak in a similar fashion - most of them also at 14 years of age - negates any semblance of verisimilitude.  In Payne's imaginary world people fall into two categories: brilliant and borderline retarded.  How could Nick's nitwit parents produce two kids who are so obviously morally, intellectually and emotionally superior in every way?  <br />  <br />At times the writing is laugh out loud hilarious.  Upon meeting a beautiful Indian girl, Nick inquires about the meaning of her name.  She responds eloquently (falling into the friend category so she's super-smart) and asks about his name's origin.  His droll response: it means a cut received while shaving.  Likewise, many of the incidents that occur - especially in the first 3rd of the book - caused me explosive fits of laughter too.  Even the middle portion of the book offers a few deliciously funny turns.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book deviates from the established characters and tone in the third act.  Nick's transformation into a wholly different person for the last third of the book means that much of his dorky fumbling and ridiculous overly convoluted machinations and day-dreamishideas slip away, along with his charm.  Suddenly, he's able to outwit everybody and essentially turns into a puppetmaster/do-gooder.   <br /> <br />Maybe Payne wanted to redeem the character's earlier failings?  Maybe he wanted to make us like Nick as some poor kid who hadn't been allowed to flourish under the harshness of his divorced parent's constant condemnation and unreasonable rules?  Whatever the reason, Payne's decision to morph Nick from underdog to Keyser Soze in training doesn't fly.  Nick's efforts culminate in ways that are too pat and many open arcs remain unclosed as if for a sequel.  Did Payne just lose steam? It's not as if Nick grows as a person either.  He changes, no doubt - becoming more cunning and sneaky - but he never matures into a character that has learned from past mistakes.  Payne's character goes from wild, almost cute, paranoid teen to hedonistic, mendacious sociopath.  Maybe that was the intention. If so, the book's extended climax (at least 50 pages), doesn't deliver on Nick's transition either.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, the ending seems more like every teen's dream come true but not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the book.  It's like Payne wanted a fairy tale ending tacked onto a story that's full of lies, deception, crimes and sex.   <br /> <br />Overall, Youth in Revolt amuses with sharp lines and a few very amusing incidents, but the tone and events in the book - sort of a poor man's Matt Ruff or Christopher Moore - never feels right with the supposed ages of the characters.  Suspension of disbelief only goes so far and then the comically absurd just becomes tedious writing by someone trying to prove to the reader how clever or smart he and his characters are.	2005-10-13

The story can be classified as a prequel to Bova's grand tour series and follows struggling industrialist Dan Randolph as he attempts to build a solar power satellite with a view to making the USA independent of that nasty Opec energy cartel.  On the way he has to battle evil terrorists and has an on again/off again romance with the wife of an aspiring US presidential candidate. <br /> <br />Everything about this novel is simplistic.  While solar power satellites may play a role in energy production some day I don't see it being any time soon, the main problem being the enormous startup cost which is currently beyond national governments, let alone one small company.  The characters in the novel are the usual Bova stereotypes and I took some offence at the politics too.  Only the bad side of the Arab world is ever alluded to. It seems that struggling American capitalists are the only good people in this world and there even seems to be a dig at the Russians too. <br /> <br />Powersat, however, is not really a bad book if you accept it for what it is.  It's just a lightweight yarn about the near future that would be good for reading on a plane trip.  If you aren't expecting a work of literature then you will probably enjoy it.	2005-10-13

The character development didn't make sense; Poole shouldn't have prtrayed Jovan's man as being so loyal in every sense then having him trick at the end. Poole tried to hard to have the novel full of twists, his desire for a surpise ending resulted in characters completley contradicting themselves.   <br /> <br />It was a quick read like all Triple Crown books, but it lacked depth. Yes I enjoyed it, but no I wouldn't pay 15 dollars check it out from the library. The writing style was nothing to rave about; it was simple and plain written.   <br /> <br />The most frusturating thing was the grammatical errors.  Is it that hard to proofread a book?  Does Triple Crown not know what a publisher's job entails?  By reading the book one time I picked up well over thirty errors.  I'm not knocking Poole for all the mistakes that's not his job, but come on there were mistakes on every other page.  The stories told from the present tense then the past tense in one sentence.  I think its best that Triple Crown authors move on after their first book to a real publisher.  Readers shouldn't be paying to proofread. <br /> <br />But I'm glad to see Poole and others doing their thang while being locked up.  I can't knock the hustle.	2005-10-13

Of those who live there, 73 percent are black, 49 percent have graduated from high school and almost all -- 98 percent -- are renters.  It encompasses Detroit's biggest drug houses, the most hookers, the best Chinese restaurant, the world's largest Masonic Temple (where we used to go see performances of the Metropolitan Opera on Tour), and a gaggle of Wayne State University students who want to live close to campus and are too poor to look elsewhere.  If you stand out in the middle of Second Avenue, a street that runs right through the Corridor (careful, you might get solicited by a cruising john), and look north, you will see what one local radio station insists on calling the 'Golden Tower' of the Fisher Building.<br /><br />This book is about a single murder in 1984 that stood out amongst Detroit's 600+ murders that year because of its brutality, and because of the odd character of the victim, who was a successful psychologist and marital counselor.<br /><br />The murder itself is an anti-climax and occurs near the end of the book.  There is no mystery about who is going to kill whom.  The meat of \\"Masquerade\\" lies in the interactions between pimp, hooker, and sugar daddy.  How did a psychologist with a thriving practice in the 'Golden Tower' of the Fisher Building and a six-bedroom, six-bathroom Tudor in Grosse Pointe Park become so involved with an ordinary streetwalker and her pimp, that he spent over $1,000/week on their drug habits?  How did he manage to keep his life in Cass Corridor a secret for over a year from his psychologist-wife?<br /><br />I can't remember the last time I read with such fascination about lethal relationships and the destruction they wrought on seemingly good marriages and friendships.  Everyone involved ended up with nightmares, even the jurors.<br /><br />Many chapters begin with an ironic quotation from the lectures and books of the murder victim or his psychologist-father.  Even though it isn't a whodunit, you're likely to form an obsessive-compulsive relationship with 'Masquerade' once you begin reading it.<br /><br />This book does sag a bit as it inches toward the murder, and it is depressing as hell to read, but I've already searched the internet to see if I can get another fix from this author.to keep his life in Cass Corridor a secret for over a year from his psychologist-wife?  <br /> <br />I can't remember the last time I read with such fascination about lethal relationships and the destruction they wrought on seemingly good marriages and friendships.

Well, maybe not that last part.  The Adventures of Soberman! is a tall glass of laugh-out-loud misadventures about the author's battle with alcoholism and everything else.  The author cleverly recounts his life experiences growing up Irish-Catholic in Hell's Kitchen, going to war in Vietnam, being married, realizing he is gay and discovering Alcoholics Anonymous-all while peppering his memories with hilarious and often touching anecdotes.

If you like Donna Kauffman, you'll like this book.  The writing style is similar. Light in fantasy and light in sensuality or heat in the romance.<br /><br />The plot of this book was a little interesting. Although, the Atlantis theme is getting a little tiresome in most books, the Dragons make the book standout.<br /><br />I was not sure if this book will have a sequel or not.  The conclusion of the book left it open as to where the book of Draca is, and what plans the Vampire King could have against the Dragons.  Also, who would be the next Guardian of the mist to the other Portal into Atlantis.<br /><br />In some ways the whole concept of Fantasy creatures like Dragons using Kelvar vests was kind of amusing.<br /><br />Here's the basic plot. After Darius's family gets wiped out, he becomes one of the Guardians of the Mist, those who guard Portals from the Surface to Atlantis. Basic they're there to kill any travelers through the portal, be it man, woman, or child. Many centuries later, Grace is looking for her brother and stumbles accidentally through the Portal. But she is wearing one of the Guardians of the Mist's amulets.  So instead of decapitating her right away he brings her to Alantis to interrogate her about where she got the necklace. From there the plot thickens with Vampires who hate the Dragons and Humans who want to rape and pillage Atlantis to sell on Ebay.<br /><br />It was nice and light fantasy romance read. I probably would read a sequel to this book if there was one. Although, I think this Harelequin line are only suppose to have non-series books. I would definitely reccomend this book.	2005-10-13

Remembering us that life and death matters are not limited to historical periods or to geographical areas far from us in time or distance.  <br /> <br />So, it is not for its precise explanation of killing techniques that I enjoy most Flashing Steel, then it is for its exceptional presentation of the warrior spirit: the ways to develop it, its general uses and its relevance in modern day society.	2005-10-13

Had I not read that book with it's emphasis on the organization, personalities and political history of the Nazis, Burleigh's work would have been even harder to follow then it was. It is implied that you have read it already or something like it, perhaps even Mein Kampf -- though the author rarely cites the latter and the former not at all --  and assumed you know the difference between a Gauleiter and Gruppenfhrer or are fully aware of the nature of the events and party infighting behind the Night of the Long Knives.  <br /> <br />You will find little information in this book about the roots of Nazism or the events that led to it's rise; nor will you get more than a glimpse of characterization of it's principal actors.  Having said that, A New History fills in some gaps left out of the popular William L. Shire work and others in the areas of economy, government, policy, and society with a very heavy emphasis on the crimes of Nazi Germany. <br /> <br />Burleigh does not try to hide -- and neither necessarily should he -- a personal bias that should be lacking in the objective observer in his view of seeing Nazi Germany as nothing but a state of pure evil with hatred it's only raison d'etre and who's only historic legacy was mass murder.  The narrative does a fine job of identifying the evolution and natural progression from eugenics to euthanasia to murders-of-convenience during wartime to large scale assembly-line genocide.  And yet, after we are told how it happened, we are still left to wonder -- and continue to wonder today, even as our own inner demons lead to events such as an abu gharib -- about the nature of the psyche that could lead sane people in a highly civilized culture to sink into barbarity.	2005-10-13

Nonetheless, the tales of his \\"outlandish\\" characters were a romp through \\"overly fictionalized\\" gay New York caricatures.<br /><br />However, this fifth book and supposed conclusion to the series is a diaster. Initially, Mordden strays from his formula because it appears he now is an author who \\"Has a Point to Make,\\" with overly simplified, pop-psychology analysis of gay life, with each of his supposed insights reduced to a three-point outline, as in \\"there are three types of gay love.\\" Mordden then attempts to justify his ridiculous analysis by using his characters to illustrate the three types of gay love, to no success.<br /><br />Despite the years that have supposedly transpired since the previous book in the series, the characters, nor the writing, have matured in the least. This book depicts New York gay life as vapid and superficial. As a former New Yorker, I can attest that while there are groups of vapid and superficial gay men (and straight people, for that matter), there are many more whose lives revolve around more than their CD collections and their gym-toned muscles.<br /><br />One of characters goes on at length against gay marriage, with the author's character merely saying that it was a wonderfully passionate position for which he (the author) would receive hate mail. Consider this review as one of those pieces of hate mail. If Ethan Mordden doesn't want equal rights, then I don't have to purchase or read his books, particularly if they're as dreadful as \\"How's Your Romance?\\"<br /><br />There is no plotline to speak of ... just a series of unconnected vignettes ... with no resolution or conclusion at the end of the book.

I've enjoyed many other cautionary tales like this in the past, and the description led me to believe this would be another good story about how dramatically things can go wrong if people don't exercise and protect their freedoms.<br /><br />...what I got instead was an overripe propaganda piece written by someone who wraps their political agenda in a flag and preaches the doctrine of Orwell's Animal Farm, modified slightly to be \\"All people are basically good, but some people are gooder than others\\".<br /><br />As no fan of the Clintons, I enjoy the occasional joke, but the overt evil of the obvious Hillary Clinton villain in this book is just too cartoonish to take seriously.  In the first chapters, it's established that she has people murdered, is a commie-loving lesbian, serves poisoned apple pie to hungry cub scouts, and eats puppies.  Well, some of that is implied, but you get the picture.<br /><br />The gestapo-like tactics of federales is one subject, but the sheer evil motivating anyone who cashes a federal paycheck was just too much.  It's almost as if the book describes a country with a couple thousand good Christian-folk \\"just livin' the life God & Jefferson dreamed of\\" surrounded by millions of scheming villain refugees from generations of B-movies.<br /><br />I couldn't actually finish the book.  I tried.  I sat down repeatedly with it and could make it through one or two pages before actually guffawing at the ridiculous plot devices before finally setting it aside.<br /><br />My recommendation: If a first edition of \\"The Turner Diaries\\" is placed prominently next to your family bible and your kids enjoy the distinction of home-schooling un-tainted by the sinful influence of science, history, and math, then by all means, buy this book.

Her style flows beautifully, making it almost impossible for readers to tear their eyes away from the page - I have rarely come across this trait of writing, which cuts down on utilising overly frivolous vocabulary, while still effectively keeping readers engaged. <br /> <br />Although I had expected that there were bound to be some 'cliches', which is hard to avoid especially with magic, Trudi has done really well in coming up with her own creative ideas. Overall, The Black Magician Trilogy is a must read for fantasy lovers. Being an avid reader, I never read books twice, since it lessens my chance of exploring other books/genres/writing styles. However, I have already broken this rule for this trilogy.

I am going to focus on the story in this collection entitled, \\"Only Partly Here\\".<br /><br />I had thought that the only reactions to what happened to New York on Sept 11 were either to put it into a political context of aggression and violence against our homeland, or to see it as too incomprehensible to articulate at all.<br /><br />Fortunately, I was wrong, and it turns out that short science fiction is the way to unpick what happened.<br /><br />Ian McEwan has said that after 9/11, he avoided invented characters and wanted to go back to school and start to learn.<br /><br />Lucius Shepard obviously doesn't feel this way as he jumped straight in and faced the challenge of articulating the experience of 9/11 through the superficially whimsical tale of a grad student and a ghost.<br /><br />Other novelists were not so strong in their vision and commitment to this task. Jay McInerney for one said that like most novelists he went through a period of intense self-examination and self-loathing after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.<br /><br />Another advantage to Lucius taking on this challenging subject matter in the tight constrictions of short fiction is that, as McInerney also says, he was incapable of reading a novel following the attack.<br /><br />Lucius has also shown the courage of his convictions.  Writing, indeed getting over a long slump in the 1990s, and keeping writing (unevenly perhaps) where other writers were distracted.  Some worked as volunteers feeding national guardsman and rescue workers, or were right by Ground Zero and so went to bed at night behind police barricades and in the odor of acrid electric fires.  Lucius was not there (as readers of his blog and movies reviews will know).  But he didn't have to be.  He took control of the situation, of the narrative of 9/11 if you will, from a distance.  He was, like Bush, elsewhere at the exact moment, but that doesn't matter.<br /><br />British and American authors (including Naipaul) have said that they agree with McEwan and that fiction seemed inadequate to the moment of a post-Sept 11 world.<br /><br />The New York Times has said that novelists have failed to engage with the \\"post 9/11 era\\".  Clearly, they have neglected to read science fiction (where Shepard is unfortunately ghettoized).<br /><br />We live in a cultural gap, an era in 2005 that debates (again) whether the novel is dead, whether documentarists such as Morgan Spurlock and Michael Moore are the only artists able to make sense of the world, and where some argue that our novelists have yet to \\"weigh in\\" and \\"make sense\\" of the events of 9/11/2001 and 7/7/2005.<br /><br />McInerney says that \\"it is to the novel that we turn to confirm our own senses and emotions to create narratives that reveal to us emotional truths.  We desperately want to have McEwan or Delillo or Roth.\\"  Interestingly, he has also said that Mailer advised him that he should wait ten years before attempting a novel about 9/11.  Mailer, the mainstream's own Lucius Shepard, counseled a slow and steady pace to analyze the vastness of the experience.<br /><br />Lucius Shepard, as close readers of his high period in the 80s will know, is never slow and steady.  He is an instinctive writer, and thus cannot analyze his own fictional processes.  His vision of how to explain 9/11 relies on the art of the fantastical.  Patrick McGrath's novella \\"Ground Zero\\" is a more complex story, and centers around a prostitute who lost a lover in the World Trade Center and is haunted by his ghost.<br /><br />The psychiatrist treating the prostitute is eventually driven mad by the events she herself failed to witness.  This is, of course, more attention-grabbing, it being a mainstream story published by a more widely read and more successfully established writer than a \\"genre\\" writer.  Unfortunately, it is also the better-written and realised story.  Shepard's is good, but in the wider understanding of 9/11 it pales beside McGrath.What McGrath also touches on, ironically, is that his is the story of mental illness brought about by being absent from the main event itself.  According to the Electric Story website, Lucius wasn't in New York during the attack.  He was in our homeland, however.  He had gone to the movies.it pales beside McGrath.

I've read it four times now and each time I gain a greater respect for Bujold's ability to tell a compelling story.  This is a difficult book to review because there is just so much going on.  The basic plot review is that Mark is back and plans to take Miles' place with the Dendarii and save at least some clones from death.  However, Mark forgot one thing--he isn't Miles and doesn't have his experience and knowledge base.  Mark also failed to recognize Miles loyalty to a brother he has never know and to his troops.  Mark also learns the hard way that people are not things and there are consequences to all actions. <br /> <br />Miles and Mark each make mistakes, misunderstand, and flounder about trying to do the right things in a situation that has no simple answers.  In the end, they each learn more about themselves then about each other but at least there's a mutual respect and a willingness to try to be family. <br /> <br />This is truly a book that you'll have a hard time putting down.  The action is fast paced, the plot threads are extremely tight, interwoven, and multi-leveled.  It's staggering that all this is told in one novel.  I laughed I cried and found myself trying to get the characters to listen to reason but alas they are already written and in the end all you can do is read on and hope that the end of the book is worth the joy and pain of the reading..  Brothers in Arms built up to this novel and Mirror Dance is a supreme payoff.	2005-10-13

My family returned to Virginia a year or two later, and for the first Christmas after we left, some of our former Summerville neighbors sent us a copy of Charleston Ghosts. I now consider it my own little treasure.  <br /> <br />Some of the stories are more memorable than others, but I think the book does a beautiful job of capturing the mystique that surrounds Charleston and the Lowcountry. The fact that, as the author says, the places in the stories are, or were, REAL places just made the stories all the more captivating to me. On a recent trip to Charleston and Hilton Head, I actually tracked down the entrances (both places are closed to the public) to Medway, which I believe is now for sale, and Brick House on Edisto Island, only the ruins of which still stand. <br /> <br />I highly recommend Charleston Ghosts!	2005-10-12

The late Professor Winks and Professor Kaiser have produced a gem of a book for the student historian. Europe, during the period covered by this book, saw a vast amount of change. England disposed of its royalty only to reinstate it, with Charles II, France became a republic, new lands/cultures were being discovered, the age of enlightenment was born and the industrial revolution occurred. Newton was discovering gravity, Voltaire was writing, Gainsborough painting and Haydn composing. The authors have covered all of these topics, and more, in a readable way that isn't weighted down with heavy prose. There are many illustrations scattered throughout which add to the enjoyment of this book.<br /><br />At a mere 199 pages it is not a text that covers any of these events in any great depth, but what it does do is to give a good introduction to them. Although concise it is not lacking relevant information. After reading this book, the student should have enough knowledge to discuss the important historiographical points from the era. The numerous references point the reader to other texts that will expand their knowledge should they need to. This is an excellent addition to the bookshelf.	2005-10-12

Do I agree with some of the reviewers who say that Straken and indeed much of this latest series isn't as original as it used to be?  Yeah, I would say that.  However, with that aside, Terry Brooks HAS managed to inject as much originality into a series that has been ongoing since 1977 as is possible.  As usual, I still find myself as eager now for his next novel as I was in High School waiting for The Wishsong to come out.  I am as many are, looking forward to a break from Shannara to see what else is bouncing around in his ingeniously creative mind.  I have hear LOTS of rumors, but after interviewing him for myself, I think that I will keep some of it quiet to allow the surprise to be that much bigger and enjoyable.<br /><br />Back to the book, though.  Straken has a wonderful finality to it which was lacking with the end of Morgawr a few years back.  The whole idea of being trapped INSIDE the Forbidding is easily one of, if not THE most creative aspect of almost all the Shannara stories since perhaps when Brooks introduced us to it originally back with Elfstones.  Knowing what to do and then being ABLE to pull it off are never quite the same with any novel set in the world of Shannara.  As is also the case with Straken.  Pen Ohmsford in his attempts to help rescue his aunt, the former Ilse Witch, banned to the Forbidding by the use of dark magic runs into many, MANY roadblocks along the way...the least of which includes evil menions of the false Ard Rhys trying to capture and kill him...watching friends die...and finding love.  Once Pen secures what he needs in order to help his aunt, he runs into you guessed it: even more problems.  That's okay.  Never fear, the outcome is never really in doubt.  The journey to find the resolution to this particular problem isn't just fun, but for me, it seemed more loaded with action and fantasy-charged testosterone than I have read from Brooks in a long time.  We get to see what a SEAL team would be like Shannara-style, and it was a real high point in the entire series.  You can definitely see additional depth to the writing skills of Mr. Brooks and fantastic character development as he continues his love of penning great stories.<br /><br />One last thought: I am a life-long fan of Terry Brooks.  He has earned my loyalty by writing great stuff again and again.  Moreover, after meeting him personally, he is easily the most down-to-earth kind and thoughtful author I have ever met.  At a book signing, it doesn't matter HOW many people are in line behind you, he treats each person as though they are the ONLY person there and doesn't put a limit to how many questions you can ask...even if it means he'll be there into the wee hours.  He certainly hasn't forgotten where he came from and WHY he is successful in the first place: his READERS.  You can say what you want about the guy, but I will ALWAYS be first in line to buy his books just as long as he continues to write them.  He always makes me feel as though my money was well spent...and when it comes down to it, isn't that all that matters?it was a real high point in the entire series.

In this world, things cannot be resolved with a simple wave of a hand.  Everything is soaked in politics and every move involves careful planning and thought (even then things don't always go the way they were planned).  This is the way wars really happen.

Very handy.  Thank you, Richard Barber!    ...  And more:  I have been a Grail hobbyist since the late 1970s, and I skipped reading Da Vinci Code because I had already read Baigent & Leigh and the subject had grown so *yawn* passe.  I've read shelves of Grail literature, and tossed aside countless books on the subject that turned out to be, well, ridiculous, or ravings, or poorly written either in terms of sloppy thinking or overmuch obfuscating.  Not that there aren't good books on the subject, just that the ratio of good to unhelpful is depressingly poor.  Barber's book is beyond helpful, it is straightforward, encyclopedic, and non-derogatory (and I totally didn't catch anything \\"cutesy\\", despite what another reviewer is grumping about).      It is of course helpful to have read a few Grail stories first!  I would recommend Malory's Morte D'Arthur (there is a lovely new edition out by Barnes & Noble if you want to treat yourself) and a nice version of Chretien de Troyes, but probably any would do, although I'd recommend a minimum of two, and from at least two separate languages or centuries (and Disney doesn't count).  It is also helpful to have a basic knowledge of the Christian Eucharist (Mass, Communion), wherein the Body and Blood of Christ are present in the Bread and Wine.  Less common but (I think) also interesting treatments also include the poetic cycles Taliessin Through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars, by Charles Williams (AKA his Arthuriad) as well as the novels of Stephen R. Lawhead.  Grail works are typically eccentric, so one must find the works that best suit one.    One of the many very useful things that Barber pointed out, for me, was the interweaving of the various forms of Christ's Blood (blood from his body vs. \\"blood\\" of Communion wine), and which he does, in my opinion, objectively, leaving the reader to decide what he or she may or may not believe.  Barber just traces what was written by whom and when... along with just enough about settings and such, not too much, but with a novella's worth of bibliography, one can read on as one desires.      When it comes to the later works, however, Barber really hits his stride in terms of critical commentary.  He agrees or disagrees with various scholars and movements, and provides names and dates so that you may, again, follow up as you like.  He seems to have been particularly moved by Wagner's Parsifal.  As Barber moves into the modern works, his tone becomes more critical.  At first I found this a little disturbing, as I had enjoyed his neutral stance regarding the early scholarship, but then I thought that it was only right, because now he is evaluating and judging writers who are his peers, whose context in culture is known to him -- those of whom, it may be said, he has \\"walked a mile in their moccasins.\\"  While I very much enjoyed the Baigent & Leigh book (Holy Blood, Holy Grail), it is in a way the modern incarnation of Erich von Daniken's _Chariots of the Gods_, which I had enjoyed as a child, and I am more than comfortable with Barber's critical dismissal of it.  Also, and perhaps this is a significant point, I am in agreement with Barber's summation of the tradition as an intergrowth of \\"imagination and belief,\\" and in fact I think I have been of that mind for some years and just unable to distill it as he has.    I've been to a number of Grail-related locations, such as the Chalice Well in Glastonbury, and that little church, I forget where, with the lamprey carved in the wall over the piscina.  Garway, maybe?    This book introduces a few more places for my list of future Grail sites to visit.  All in all, an unprecedented work, and a much welcome sanity break in a typically subjective genre.    My review hardly does justice to this amazing work.  If you or someone you know is a Grail hobbyist, please at least have a look at this book.

As this review is titled, this is a 200 page book packed into 489 pages. The premise is interesting, but there the value ends. I agreed with most of the author's viewpoints, but found them poorly presented. The author has the  conceit to abandon conventional puctuation without the innovation in writing to warrant it. I suspect she is embarassed to have so little going on and so much dialog that she has chosen not to use quotation marks. The dialog is unconvincing. Character development is weak, and the characters are fairly flat. The attempts at humor are incredibly weak, for example, the bits about the landscaping at the self-indulgent woman's house are a bit sad, but not convincing enough to be humor or to be satisfactory commentary on modern life.  <br /> <br />There is a lot of extraneous verbage in this, to no value. The worst is the sophomoric pseudo-philosophy, which should have been left in the college dorm 3:00 AM B.S. sessions. A good thing to do at that age, but this doesn't belong in a novel. A few pithy observations would have been powerful. Instead, one feels stoned to death with popcorn. <br /> <br />This book might have be passable with a strong editor. There is a strong temptation to skim, but the stuff relating to the plot is buried in the junk. I suspect this is an attempt for a movie deal, as you can sense the treatments. Not recommended unless you are less than 21.	2005-10-12

The editing, however, is terrible.  The author can take the blame for the blatantly human metaphors that sometimes appear in the thoughts of the birds.  But the editor is probably the one who should be fired over the grammatical errors, misused words, horribly punctuated sentences (random useless commas everywhere), and, most scandalously, misspellings!

Owens takes us on the vivid journey of Morris \\"Mookie Love\\" Lovett as he pursues his dream to become a star rapper.  Owens' \\"A Dream Come True\\", starts out innocently enough with Mookie finding out that he won a major talent contest that his best friend, Fatimus Brown, had entered for him.  The trouble begins as soon as Mookie gets the good news; his father, former professional basketball star, is adamantly opposed to Mookie becoming a rapper and moving to Los Angeles.<br /><br />Mookie refuses to give up his dream and forges ahead bringing Pam Rivera, his longtime girlfriend, and Fatimus (\\"Fat\\" as they call him) with him to L.A. to pursue their own dreams.  Immediately, Mookie begins to succumb to the trappings of being famous as drugs and women threaten his relationships with both Fat and Pam.  Mookie becomes so caught up in being famous that he fails to notice the deceptions around him.  Once he does, is he too far out of control to understand the consequences of the choices he has made?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Pam and Fat experience a little drama of their own.  Torn between supporting Mookie and acheiving their own goals, Pam and Fatimus turn to each other creating a twist that leads to a interesting revelation.  Even while Pam longs for the Mookie that she knew before all the fame began, she drifts away from him hiding her own secrets and reeling from his betrayals.  Fatimus hopes to create some interest in his own life, other than being middleman to Mookie and Pam's relationship.  Bored of playing online chess and watching Sci-fi movies, Fat makes several comedic attempts at dating. Still, Fatimus has some decisions to make once he is dealt several major blows in his life.<br /><br />These three have been friends a long time, but the questions remain: can their friendship withstand the move to Los Angeles and the glare of Mookie's fame? Can they stand up to the lies and betrayals? Will they still be friends once all truths are exposed? Can Mookie get his life back on track or has his dream turned into a nightmare?<br /><br />Owens does an excellent job of pulling you into the story of Mookie, Pam, and Fatimus making you care about these characters and what will happen to them next.  An easy read, \\"A Dream Come True\\" is still a page-turner.  Fascinating and sexy, \\"A Dream Come True\\" is fast-paced, entertaining and hard to put down.

Heart-rending, heart-breaking, filled with fury and indignation, love and the hope of reconciliation, political diatribe and aesthetic redemption, \\"Shalimar\\" reads like no other contemporary work.  Passages of marvelous beauty (particularly of the early love between Shalimar and Boonyi, two of the novel's central characters), of the triumph of art over ideology (particularly Bombur Yambarzal's humorous and heroic deflation of the humorless and despicable mullah, Bulbul Fakh), and of the unmitigated horrors of war (particularly the destruction of the once near-utopian village of Pachigam, perhaps one of the most tragic passages in modern literature) confront readers at nearly every turn.  This is one of the most densely populated (in the sense of characterization as well as ideas) novels of recent years, perhaps even more apocalyptically epic in scope than Rushdie's own \\"Midnight's Children.\\"  Most important of all, Rushdie proves (once again) that politics and literature can be mutually enriching as well as informative; that art can teach more profoundly than any ideology (religious or political); and that hope and beauty--in the midst of the very worst of human-made atrocities-- will find a way (sometimes) to persevere.  This is a difficult, angry novel; but make no mistake, it will reward the patient (and thoughtful) reader with a profoundly moving experience.  Indeed, Rushdie reminds us all why the novel remains one of the most pertinent and potent of today's artistic venues.	2005-10-12

Kagura Sohma arrives at the Sohma family home and whisks Kyo away on an afternoon date. Yuki decides to take Tohru out as well. While out on their date, Kagura becomes concerned about Kyo's distance issues with people. A surprise guest arrives at the Sohma home, Kyo's former martial arts trainer Kazuma Sohma. Kyo becomes truly happy in his presence for the first time in the whole series and begs his master to take him away from the Sohma home. Kazuma decides to challenge Kyo by encouraging him to reveal his \\"true form\\" to the world to get over his own worthlessness. Tohru sees Kyo's true self, and he runs from her in shame. Rather than deal with her rejection or pity he decides it would be best to avoid her at all costs.  There are some wonderful, tearful moments that follow as she decides if he is too hideous in his natural form or not. Kyo runs off before his master departs, leaving everyone in the Sohma house in shock at his disappearance. Tohru sees Kazuma off as he speaks about the true nature of his feelings in his relationship with Kyo.<br /><br />New feelings of distrust develop in the Sohma house as both Yuki and Kagura start to stray from the others. Hatsuharu expresses his concern over Yuki's recent mood and Tohru comes just in time to lend an ear about Yuki's plans for the summer.<br /><br />Yuki takes an interest in his older brother, Ayami, and decides to bridge the gap by visiting Ayami's business.  What Tohru innocently thinks to be a uniform shop turns out to be a place devoted to male fantasies, and though this disgusts Yuki he manages to stay to chat with Ayami thanks to some distraction brought on by Ayami's assistant and Tohru's decision to try on some of Ayami's goods.<br /><br />Wow... the reading is getting so good, not that it wasn't before, but the character development is reaching a height at this point... Kyo is quickly usurping Yuki as my favorite, especially when it comes to him being in the running for tohru's heart...

Like John Wayne and Cary Grant, Bogart was larger than life, yet, unlike them, he was also down in the dirt with the rest of us. An average guy in many ways, the characters he played beat the odds, but only after enormous effort and struggle.<br /><br />A.M. Sperber's generally excellent biography shows that Bogart the icon and Bogart the man shared many similar traits. Though the son of a wealthy doctor and his artist wife, there was a dark side to Bogart's outwardly pampered life. His mother was distant, his father was addicted to morphine, and the young boy and his sisters, one of whom suffered from mental illness, were abused by the servants. Bogart was an academic failure with little hope for success until distinguishing himself on Broadway with his classic portrayal of Duke Mantee in \\"The Petrified Forest.\\"<br /><br />But even when Hollywood beckoned, life didn't get easier for the insecure actor. While James Cagney, George Raft, Paul Muni, and Edward G. Robinson were \\"stars\\" who got the best roles Warner Bros. had to offer, Bogart was taken for granted, a mere contract player who played supporting roles in the important projects, and spent years buried in a series of undistinguished B flicks churned out on the Hollywood assembly line. Well paid, especially by Depression era standards, he nonetheless struggled to support his ailing sisters and to pay off his late father's debts.<br /><br />Today, it's hard to believe his employers took so long to recognize the charisma and talent that Bogart would bring to \\"High Sierra\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" both of which were intended for that great non-entity George Raft. \\"Casablanca,\\" of course, made Bogart the biggest star on the Warner lot, and Sperber shoots down the myth that both Raft and Ronald Reagan were initially considered for the role of Hollywood's ultimate romantic hero. For once, a role was tailor-made for Bogart, and the legend was born.<br /><br />Bogart's early life isn't covered as thoroughly as hoped, but that's not a surprise since most of those who could provide insight into the future superstar had died long before Sperber began her book. But the career is well documented, and the man behind the myth emerges as a flesh and blood figure, a fiercely intelligent and generally admirable one, on every page.<br /><br />Brian W.

Oh we all guessed on who it was going to be.  I had three guesses and had reasons for them all.  In the end one of my guesses was right, actually in a strange way two of them were. <br /> <br />It was really the only way the story could have ended, sad as it is, someone had to die so that Harry had no choice but to confront Voldemort. <br /> <br />Basic plot:  Harry and co are getting ready to take their O.W.L or possible N.E.W.T. (I forget which one) and are nervouse about the outcome.  Added to that, tensions between just about everyone is at an all time high.   Snape has finally gotten a shot to teach Defense against dark arts and their is a new potions teacher who takes a liking to Harry and Hermoine but has no use for Ron.  Dumbledore has agreed to show Harry some more about who and what Voldemort really is.  And finally Harry finds a potions book that makes him the star of potions class, that once belonged to someone who calls himself, the \\"Half Blood Prince.\\" <br /> <br />The this chapter of the Harry Potter Saga is tragic in a lot of ways, but also quite lovely.  You see once again how close Harry really is to the friends he has made since the first book.  One scene in particular where Ron's mother (forget her name) after Harry saves the life of one of her children, tells Harry that thier family is lucky to have him in thier lives, and you just know that Harry is thinking that he is the lucky one. <br /> <br />All in all a beautiful and tragic story about growing up and chosing what is really important in life.	2005-10-12

I have vowed to make notes on all of the library books we check out each week so that, should I have a book faintly perched on the edge of my mind, I will be able to scan back through my reviews until I find the one I am remembering.

She especially loves the phrase \\"Where, oh where, is my child?\\"  She got that one dead-on.  This is an excellent book for retelling and could be acted out very successfully in a short dramatic play in kindergarten.  The plot is simple and fun and leads to great discussions about how humans prepare for winter (gathering the harvest, preserving foods by canning them) vs. animals who hibernate (that would be the bear).  This book is, of course, need I say it????  A winner.  You won't be disappointed if you purchase this one.  And little Sal (Sally?  It's a girl) is as cute as a button.

Lawson does not seem very favorably disposed to those she describes.  She describes some who behave rather badly (killing their children in some cases). <br /> There's always been a problem with psychiatric diagnoses that we cannot confirm by blood tests or X-rays. The \\"borderline personality\\" diagnosis is especially fuzzy. It fits anyone who is selfish and over-emotional.  Lawson stretches the diagnosis to include a number of well-known personalities she has never met, and blurs the edges even more. She adds a typology of her own; the waif, the queen, the witch and the hermit. These are just off the top of her head and are not validated by any kind of statistics or experimental work.  When she does mention anything about brain chemistry or anatomy or about medication it's in passing, and some of it is wrong.  <br /> The ways of managing such mothers she suggests are more in the nature of advice for their children (often quite good advice) than proven methods of therapy. <br /> The quality of the writing is excellent. The author knows how to tell a story and keep the pages turning. I'm sure many will read it and recognize situations or people they have encountered, as we do when we read a good novel. This is closer to imaginative literature than to science, but it's very good imaginative literature. <br />	2005-10-12

I've read this book some years back and what an eye-opener! Throughout my years of being in school, starting with the first time I stepped into one at around the tender age of four, I always felt there was something not right about the place we call school. Since reading this book, I finally understood what I was trying to get at when I would tell my mother \\"school is torture\\", \\"school is boring and stupid\\", and other such unsophisticated ways of expressing what this system that I was told was for my own good was really doing to me. It tends to be worse if, like myself, you were in special education. In there, they trump up your disabilities, label you, and make your situation sound so much worse than it really is.  <br /> <br />I was someone who never really went along with teachers' wishes simply because I found the curriculum boring and uninteresting in addition to the fact that a lot of times I never got a single drop of human respect from them. As a result I was tagged as being lazy, uncooperative, unable to follow directions and a list of other names I care not to get into. What I felt they never understood about me was that I'm a very independent learner. I quickly found out that they didn't want independent learners. They wanted intellectual dependence from their students. You learn THEIR way or face the consequences. I noticed in my experiences that they often tried to undermine my mother or otherwise keep her out of the equation. Sometimes by doing things that were underhanded or even illegal. <br /> <br />While this book paints a lofty picture of history and despite Mr. Gatto's party affiliation (which in my opinion should be irrelevent...you can still learn from this book), it does present in a concise form what is wrong with our schools. However, the deterioration of our \\"education\\" system is part of a larger social-economic-political problem. Any school ran by the government is going to have an agenda. Be it in service of the state's agenda (read not necessarily good for you) or a corporate sponsored agenda. <br /> <br />For those who said that Mr. Gatto gave no solutions to the problems he describes, the scope of the book is not about the solutions. I believe you'll find the documentation and solutions in his other book. It is important to include in the solution that not every parent is fit to teach and not everyone has a teriffic homelife. As the old saying goes, \\"it takes a village to raise a child\\". Keep in mind that a lot of these parents were graduates of the very same system Gatto shreds to pieces. It is important to have a thriving and involved community but to a child, there's nothing more important than a loving and involved parent. There's no replacement for that.  <br /> <br />Overall, this book was very informative and very helpful to me. It's quite an illumination and validated me and my feelings. I got a personal sense of satisfaction from this book because I realized in a very short amount of time after high school, I learned more than I ever did in those 12 years and I did it on my own without the help of \\"experts\\" telling me I wasn't good enough to learn on my own. I also learned that the things that happened in those 12 years weren't necessarily my own fault. I felt imensely validated by this book and realized that I am not and never was crazy or a bad person because I refused to be obedient just for the sake of being obedient. <br /> <br />I totally recommend this book because it allows you to see the problems and take the appropriate steps to do more research on it and do something about it.	2005-10-12

What it amounts to is a single, run-on \\"chapter\\" detailing murder after murder.  There is zero information regarding any aspect of Hardin's life other than killing people and the events immediately before and after each episode.  These are strung together with variations on the phrase \\"nothing of interest happened until...\\" Apparently nothing much interested Hardin's small mind except mayhem.   <br /> <br />Hardin claims to have been hunted by increasingly large and diverse groups of men over impossible distances and yet, miraculously, information of his whereabouts always precedes him in such a way that various \\"posses\\" manage to fall upon his precise position in the middle of the enormous Texas backfield.  <br />In event after event Hardin claims to be on the side of truth and justice as he guns down lawman after lawman.  His logic process in justifying his frequent murders is so obtuse as to be laughable and reads like an older person's version of \\"the dog ate my homework.\\"  <br /> <br />Considering that he is generally the victim of surprise attacks it is a stretch to believe that he nearly always comes away without a scratch, even against impossible odds, while repeatedly managing to shoot at least one or two of his opponents directly in the center of the forehead.  To believe Hardin, one would have to conclude that only the most inept persons were employed in law enforcement, that they were all horribly poor marksmen, and that Hardin was not only the victim of a completely improbable string of circumstances but also the only person in Texas who hit exactly what he aimed at, every time, even under the worst of shooting scenarios.  To believe Hardin, one would have to be gullible in the exterme.  To believe Hardin one would have to be an idiot. <br /> <br />Even a cursory reading will show the reader that Hardin was, above all, a braggart.  His other talents included being a liar, a thief, a murderer and a pin head.  It would appear that the only reason Hardin's story remains in print is that it is a rare example of an autobiography of a blue-collar murderer from this era.   <br /> <br />Don't waste your money. <br />	2005-10-12

As i just said, i enjoyed the book very much, and true i did not understand half of what the man said, but if you truely love physics i think you can get something out of this. Maybe im strange, but i enjoyed this book so much. One great thing about it was the fact of his view on string theory. Not often will one find such a view as he has on the subject and it has lead me to question my earlier views on the subject. Also, I had never heard of Twistor Theory before and now i see it has some value and that i may start to persue it in my college career along with the new versions of string theory with 4 deminsions that he spoke of.  Over all, people who give this book a bad rating, just are not seeing the book for what it is. And that is a general guide to the most important theories, one that may not be the most percise at every turn, nook and craney, but one that is a great 1045 page guide to things in general and help people see the elegance in the math involved in physics.	2005-10-12
US	16516837	RG39M04VK3CD0	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Great Animal Book	I've been trying to figure out why this book stands out as possibly the best of the fifteen I have read this year.  Surely because it was the Booker Prize winner.  I think, in large part, it is also because this novel honors animals in an almost mythological way, not surprisingly, perhaps, because the narrator Pi is himself of the  Hindu faith, as well as being part Muslim and part Christian. \\"Life Of Pi\\" makes animals seem if anything more important in the chain of being than humans. This is a habit of thought that may have been lost in urbanized modern society, though it wasn't too many decades ago that even American farmers were dependent upon animals for transportation and for work in a way that we are now dependent upon the internal combustion engine.  There are other books that do so (possibly Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Jungle Book,\\"; perhaps \\"The Lion King\\", though I don't know \\"The Lion King\\" very well; certainly American Indian  and apparently Hindu mythology.)The other novel that I have read recently that comes the closest to achieving this same effect is John Nicols' remarkable  \\"The Milagro Beanfield War\\" which does so by also telling a very human story about traditional New Mexican farmers, and also, to a lesser extent, its sequel \\"Nirvana Blues\\" which has certain elements of Hindu religion--in particular monkey worship-- as part of the plot. All of the above  anthropomorphize animals in a very positive way. \\"Life Of Pi\\" does so by placing Pi on a liferaft in very close proximity with animal refugees from a zoo after a freighter sinks, and Pi, after losing his family,  also encounters numerous denizens of the sea, fish, reptile,mammal and fowl, on his 200-plus day ocean journey. In the early part of the book, Pi reflects on his early life as son of a zoo keeper in French India and the tone of respect for animals is consistent in these early sections as well, even when he describes why he believes animals are better off in zoos, than in the wild, or when hereflects on the personalities of animals.  Furthermore, Pi describes his religious beliefs in these early sections. It may have been a stroke of luck, but this book is exceptionally well written, concise and not overblown. It also includes many passages,naturally, about survival skills.	2005-10-12

These co-authors have written for an audience that will already be convinced of the worthwhileness of their thesis, i.e., that America is the new \\"chosen land.\\" For a non-American, looking  backwards in history from the present day,the argument is not quite so convincing. Certainly, the faith and courage exhibited by the earliest pioneeers makes for inspirational reading and, to be fair, the authors work quite hard to sustain the impetus of their presentation. The narrative lags seriously in a few places and the writers' uncertainties are made apparent to the reader, which hardly adds to the power of the argument.

The author recounts ad nauseum her daily routine involving visits to her sick daughter and meetings with doctors, with very little insight into the depth of her feelings or the tragedy of loss.

The book is hard to read for someone who speaks American English. I had to re-read articles, especially the oldest ones. Trying to figure out what the point was.  <br />I would recommend someone to completely rewrite the articles, preserving the message and translating it for the modern man.	2005-10-12

Now with summer vacation here the Sohma house is relaxed and the occupants are free to do whatever they want...all except for Yuki, who must spend his days with the student council. He meets two other members of the council  one early summer day. Later Arisa Uotani meets an older gentleman at her work who begins to occupy her thoughts. Little does she know the connection this enigmatic man has to some very close friends of hers.<br /><br />Hanajima's past and true powers are revealed further, plus the connection that she shares with Uotani and Tohru. Also a lunch date at Kyo's Master's house unearths surprises as the host suddenly has to depart for a meeting with Kyo's real father. Some of the plans for Kyo's future are revealed.<br /><br />Momitchi Sohma invites everyone to a vacation retreat. A baseball cap, one of Tohru's prized possessions, comes into question from Yuki. Apparently, when she was a child, Tohru met a young boy who helped her and left behind his hat. What connection does this have to the Sohma family? And at the end, a surprise guest shows up, another Sohma, but who is this mysterious young woman, and why is she being so affectionate with Shigure?<br /><br />Hmmm... prediction, naturally it's obvious but what the heck, I'll say it. Does anyone else think that Arisa's older gentleman friend is involved with the Sohmas? Yeah, no one can be that mysterious and not be. Still hopelessly addicted, as my mad reviewing is proving, I just love this series so much, it's completely sucked me in.	2005-10-12

Starmore is a great knitting historian, and those two books mentioned are incredible resources for traditional work.<br /><br />Even this book of men's sweaters has a few nice traditional patterns that would be good for any era.  The traditional gansey that opens the book is one of these.<br /><br />However, I was quite shocked at how dated many of the patterns are in this book. As a man, I can say that in the whole book there were maybe only 2-3 sweaters I would ever be caught dead in.  My wife was more or less laughing at many of the designs.  Obviously each to their own, but be warned that this is not like Starmore's other books of 'timeless' classics.<br /><br />Also disappointing is that the book is mostly just patterns.  Alice Starmore's best stuff -- her instructional writing and knitting history writing -- is not present in this book, making it significantly less interesting than the previously mentioned Fair Isle and Aran Island books.<br /><br />It is cheaper than other Starmore books, but the lower price reflects an inferior product.  Maybe the patterns will be enough for some, but for me, if I am going to spend so much for an out of print book, I want more than just a few good patterns.<br /><br />UPDATE (2/2/2012): The price for a used copy of this book has dropped considerably since I first wrote the review.  The current price of $18, is a pretty reasonable price when you consider that there are at least 2 quality patterns in this book. At the time I wrote the original review, the price was more than $50, which IS too much considering that the majority of the patterns are not up to Starmore's usual quality level.	2005-10-12

I am a fan of Mary Monroe's...I could not wait to read this book as I have enjoyed so many titles of Mrs.Monroe's....but I could've done without this one. I had so many issues with this book I do not know where to start. First of all there a too many people in this story, I mean to sit through all of the introductions is almost mind numbing. I did not feel the story-line was had any substance. I was bored at times while reading this book. I also did not understand why this book was set in present time and everybody in the book sounded as if it was 30-40 years ago. Why did they have names like \\"Lula Mae, Odessa, Verna, and Rosalee\\"? I kept forgetting it was present time and thought it was the 1960's or something. Obviously Monroe is a excellent writer, we know that from previous books, but her element is writing about the past. Some of the \\"slang\\" in this novel was just horrible. The one person that kept this book from being a one was Helen. In a way I felt the book should've been about her. She is the only one that I really cared about. I wish the book would've been written for her, Lula's and Rockell's POV.....I did not need the other 7 characters. So if you are looking for a good read that compares to the likes of \\"God Don't Like Ugly\\" \\"God Still Don't Like Ugly\\" and \\"The Upper Room\\", then do not read this book. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Tiresome though the overly lengthy descriptions can be, there're less annoying this time. The characterisation is more straightforward, major plotlines are resolved, some of which are long prophesized.  <br /> <br />Ok, so far I've only talked about how it isn't as bad as COS and POD. Now I'll talk about what I felt was good.  <br />The overall epic mood of the story seems to have come back. The buildup to the resolution of certain plotlines, though slow, have a gritty hands on feel to it.  <br />The characters are more real and serious this time. This time, conflicts end with nice quick deaths or submissions. No more pointless conflicts that last for books and books. In fact, a lot of supporting characters are killed off, and I rather liked the fact that RJ didn't stuff the ensuing grief down our throats. I think its so much more poignant when readers are left to empathise for themselves. <br />The courtship of Tuon was rather funny, and its rather satisfying how Mat, my fav hero, showed that he was nobody's Toy.  <br />RJ seems to have tried pruning its writing, its now more entertaining and informative, though still in a somewhat long-winded way. But the long-windedness doesn't drag down the storytelling to a standstill anymore. Even when a chapter is only building up to something bigger at the end, its still contains enough interesting info, jokes, tactics, and shock to make the read worthwhile. <br />And ooooh, Morgase starts channelling for real instead of whining about how she's too weak to even try. Should be fun when Queen Elayne finally meets her mom, hehehe. <br />And Vandene gets her revenge! <br />And there's finally a glimmer of hope of seeing Moiraine again, though Light knows if she'll actually escape alive since I dun think it was mentioned anywhere that Rand needs her to win the Last Battle <br /> <br />And the bad. <br />I really really hate Egwene, ever since she brutally bullied Nynaeve in Book 5, and then felt no shame at all in what she did. RJ wants to make her great, but he's doing it at the expense of dumbing down her friends, enemies and predicaments. When you read KOD and think how great she is, then start thinking how well she'll cope if she was under Therava, forced to swear fealty under the oathrod, and there's no Healing allowed after each torture session. Or if she's being held by Darkfriends instead.  <br />Next, a few chapters are from the POV of obscure Seanchan or other minor characters. I dun know them well enough to care about reading several pages of their POV, so I wish RJ had just summarized their POV into a few paragraphs.  <br />Next, the buildup to resolving certain plotlines are unneccessarily slow. Such as the rescue of Faile. And also Elayne's claiming of the Throne. Everybody KNOWS the outcome already, and its not like these are important enough to be foretold in the prophecies or have any obvious dire consequences.  <br />Next, its always the women that get caught and tortured! And usually by other women. Does RJ have repressed sadistic S/M tendencies? Why can't the men, especially the men Forsaken, get caught and tortured? I thought there was a chance of seeing at least the capture of a male forsaken in female flesh, but alas, not even that. <br /> <br />Oh, and the monkey-see-monkey-do whiny reviews online and everywhere else are the worst part about reading WOT. Thank the Light I dun have to read them unless I'm feeling particularly psychotic. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

It is written more for the higher-educated than for the common folk.  As a person who has read Kramer's 'Listening to Prozac,' I kept waiting and hoping that Kramer would clarify the changes (if any) in his thinking since his former popular, best-selling book.  Most people understand that medical studies, medical technology and medical understanding can change a person's view on some issues, but it seemed like Kramer was unable or unwilling to verbalize the possible changes in some of his beliefs since 'Listening to Prozac.\\"  I kept waiting for him to say, 'I think that now, with what we know, there are more instances that the use of antidepressants may be more beneficial to people because...\\"  But, it never happened. For first time readers of his work, the book is excellent. But, for those who have read some of Kramer's previous work, you may be left with the feeling that you just want to sit him down and outright interview him so you can ask him where he stands NOW.	2005-10-12

Watching TV, reading the newspapers, I concluded that there was a major flood in 1927 which came down the Mississippi.  Because the monied of New Orleans feared that the \\"better part of town\\" might be in danger, they arranged to dynamite the levees in such a way that would divert the waters into St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes.  Certain eminent domain and financial arrangements were made (and later reneged on) and those who could and would be were evacuated.  All the same, many died and many more would made homeless, for the potential benefit to the few.  Then, or so I heard, the outrage of the masses in Louisiana at this miscarriage of power and justice by the rich led to the election of Huey P. Long (as champion of the \\"little guy\\") as Governor and launched a career. <br /> <br />Well, too bad.  This book doesn't go down that road at all.  The flood of 1927 is barely touched on.  Yes, it happened, but there is no mention of the dynamited dams.  Yes, Hoover came down and was in charge of federal relocation and recovery.  And in the meantime, Huey was running about the same campaign he would run for the rest of his life: Down with the Rich! Up with the Poor! and All Hail Huey!   <br /> <br />Williams' biography is incredibly well documented.  You get the feeling that if you just tore out the bibliography, the notes, and the index, you would be forced to write the same book yourself, with one caveat:  some parts of the book were written from the author's notes of interviews and private communications the author had with some of the principals who were still alive when it was written through the 1950s and 60s.  The author has promised that all the notes have been archived and that while not of them can be released as yet, eventually, they all will be.  Williams is quite vigorous not so much in defense of Long as in definition of the man and his vision.  If you want to decide for yourself justwhat sort of man Huey Long was and where he might have been going, this biography is an excellent place to start.	2005-10-12

For me, The Forgotten Soldier is that book. I read a beat up battered company at the Webster Groves Library in 1980 and my understanding of the Second World War has never been the same.<br /><br />Guy Sager's narrative will keep you reading page after page. This man's experiences are so incredible, embarrassing, harrowing and heroic all at once. From a conscripted truck driver, young Sager evolves into a member of the Wehrmacht's greatest division, the Grossdeutschland Panzer Grenadier Division.<br /><br />Sager endures horrific training that seems appropriate to forging the kind of soldiers who would go on to survive Kursk, Orel, Belgorod, Operation Bagration and the agony of East Prussia. We see the war in Russia from a German perspective and begin to appreciate what it was truly like for young German men fighting not for National Socialism, but ultimately for their own survival. I believe Sager captures the one true reality of men in combat, that ultimately they are fighting for one another without any concern for the religious or political circumstances that thrust them into war.<br /><br />As other reviewers had mentioned, this book lays bare the ugly realities of war and the very real pain and suffering that accompany it. It is powerful and sobering reading that will ultimately allow you to appreicate the peaceful lives, which so many of us are priviledged to enjoy.	2005-10-12

Our department selected this book before I arrived at the school in what I've gathered was a flurry of political correctness hysteria to \\"The American Pageant's\\" emphasis on white men.  Even if Murrin's book makes an effort to be more PC (sometimes to a fault) it makes the much bigger mistake of assuming that readers already have a fairly sophisticated background in American History.  I think it's interesting reading, but then again, I have a degree in history, so trying to learn how the concept of 18th century mercantilism is connected to the 19th century concept of progress all on the same page isn't really a major feat of mental gymnastics.  Most teachers in my department don't even use the book because it's too confusing for the kids.  If I could have my way, we'd just sell them all and buy something that's (gulp) a little simpler. <br /> <br />To its credit, the book has a nice website with lots of maps and images and resources - but in my memory as a high school student (which was during the age of the internet), a clear, concise textbook was a foundation of learning and more important than a nice website.

He is also progenitor of ordinary language philosophy and ordinary common sense. The sensible world is restored as a first principle; something that cannot be proven, but all must concede exists. And all perception is veridical. The Inquiry captures all the nuances of the five senses as we ordinarily have come to know them. Ditto, reason, which is the focus of the first Essay. Yes, reason can lead one into infinite regress, especially when it comes to causes and effects, but we necessarily rely on some element of reason (conception, imagination, judgment) to give us bearings in the world. The final Essay is on morality. It is the least interesting, if only because Reid appeals to the \\"Author of our being\\" to establish first principles of right and wrong. Even so, humans are endowed naturally with a moral sense so that many of the appeals to God could just as easily be appeals to our endowment by human nature. But the number of his first principles is inordinate.<br /><br />One of the problems with Reid's entire approach is the number of his first principles. I stopped counting after forty. Somehow that many first principles defeats the whole notion of first principle. Even if I agree with Reid that Descartes' starting point, the thinking self, is the wrong first principle, at least Descartes starts with one first principle and deduces others. Likewise, Berkeley and Hume, one to an idealist conclusion, one to a sceptical conclusion. Reid's approach is manifestly opposite. Since he insists so much of what we are consists of numerous first principles, soon the whole notion of \\"first principle\\" loses its meaning. In a sense, to save the rest of ordinary language and common sense philosophy, he must abuse the ordinary notion of \\"first principle.\\"<br /><br />Somehow, there needs to be a better balance. Surely, that man is sentient can itself be a first principle, and that man is a rational animal can be another, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.other, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.	2005-10-12

This was the conundrum I came face to face with while reading Sujata Massey's latest Rei Shimura mystery novel, \\"The Typhoon Lover,\\" and discovered, rather to my surprise, that the answer was a resounding \\"yes.\\"    When US intelligence suspect that Takeo Kayama, head of the Kayama School of Ikebana and Rei Shimura's former lover, may have bought an antique Mesopotamian ewer that was stolen during the latest gulf war, they decide to recruit Rei in order to discover how Takeo had acquired the piece. As a friend and former lover, the feeling is that Rei should be able to get the information without setting off too many alarm bells. And while Rei is not at all sure if she's cut out for this kind of cloak and dagger stuff, or even if she could persuade Takeo in take her into his confidence (much less talk to her since they did have a rather messy breakup), the lure of being able to return to Japan (Rei was deported from Japan in \\"Samurai's Daughter), proves too much for her. And in no time at all, Rei finds herself back in her beloved Japan, and trying to reconnect with a newly engaged Takeo, who would much rather keep Rei at arm's length. And while Rei was prepared for the fact that it would take a lot of hard work in order to reestablish their friendship, what she was not prepared for, she discovers to her horror, was the resurgence of some of her old feelings for Takeo, or how her flashly blundering about would lead to tragedy...    There were many things I liked about \\"The Typhoon Lover\\" -- like the fact that it took place mostly in Japan, and that it was a very well written, suspenseful, absorbing and totally riveting novel. However certain things did niggle at me: for example, I really had to suspend my disbelief in order to buy the notion that the US secret service's best bet to figuring out if Takeo was involved in buying stolen antiques was to bring Rei into the investigation. Surely must have been a better plan out there somewhere? I like the character, Rei Shimura, but her method of operation has always been to stumble about, rather flashily, until she arrives at the truth. Subtlety and discretion have never really been her strong points. And this was the woman that US intelligence thought perfect for this particular job? I also found that I was not really enjoying this new direction that the author was taking Rei in -- esp in regards to her relationship with Hugh (her on-and-off again boyfriend), after having gone through so much with Hugh, I was disappointed that Rei felt stifled by her relationship with him, and how she handled things here. But in spite of my growing frustration with Rei, I found that I simply had to read on in order to discover what would happen next. And this, in my opinion, was the real testament to Sujata Massey's brilliant writing skills -- that she had me absolutely riveted in spite of myself. Also brilliantly done, was how the authored portrayed the tense atmosphere as everyone was hunkering down to deal with the typhoon -- I really felt the cold, wet danger of it all. And as always, I enjoyed the author's portrayals of the current trends in Japan; and in this instance, Rei's feelings of confusion at realising that she may no longer fit in with the youth culture.     In all, \\"The Typhoon Lover\\" was a very enjoyable read. In spite of my complaints, at the heart of things, this series has not changed. Rei is still the flawed but stalwart character, who still passionately throws herself into whatever task she's doing. She may stumble about with two left feet, angering people and setting off alarm bells everywhere, but she's always determined to do the right thing and see justice done. That's the Rei Shimura that's won fans everywhere and the Rei Shimura that will always be at the heart of this series, in spite of whatever direction the author takes her heroine in.	2005-10-12

The first half of the book dealt with laying the background to the story.  Shy Crissy decides to take a month long cruise with her not shy friend, Jenny.  They are unaware that the family that owns that cruise line is in huge financial trouble and the owner is planning on having the ship blown up to collect the insurance money.  It doesn't matter to him that there would be people on board when this occurs. <br /> <br />A lot of time is devoted to hearing every man that Crissy encounters tell her how beautiful, intelligent and interesting she is.  It gets old constantly reading that.  We get it, she's pretty.  She meets a guy at a bar, they go home together, and after one night, she believes he's \\"the one.\\"  Do I need to say she never hears from him again?  That was when she decided she needed to change her life and booked the cruise. <br /> <br />Once on the trip, she meets a group of people that her and Jenny spend most of their meals with.  Jenny hops from one guy to another and she gets jealous of Crissy because a guy that passed on her is interested in Crissy.  They argue, Jenny moves out of their cabin.  Crissy begins a secret affair with the ship's doctor.  Very slowly, the story then starts to pick up. <br /> <br />I am a person that will finish a book unless it's so horrible that it's impossible to do so.  I did consider giving up on this one, but that's when the story picked up, so of course, I had to finish it to see how it would end.  I won't give anything away, but there weren't any surprises to keep you guessing. <br /> <br />I've enjoyed Judith Gould's books in the past and I will try her next one.  I have to hope that it will be better than this one. <br /> <br />If you want to read this one, wait the six months until it comes out in paperback or rent it from the library.  It's not worth the hardcover price.	2005-10-12

We see a life destroyed, and we see a life painstakingly rebuilt. <br /> <br />But the book succeeds so well not because its elements are dramatic -- though that helps -- but because of Pie Dumas' story-telling prowess.

I read the back cover and wanted to see how the author worked through the conflict. It was a bit slow to start (for me,) but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. The conflict with her sister's marriage was realistic and gut-wrenching, and I wish it had turned out with a happier ending, but hey, that's not reality. In regards to Hanna, I liked the way the author brought everything to a climax toward the ending. I felt Micah's pain as well as Hanna's. It is a wonderful story of forgiveness.

The philosophy was OK but not great and it was buried in a non-plot story.  The language, when used for philosophy was OK, but the rest of the time it was either tired and pedestrian or just plain potty mouth.<br /><br />The \\"story\\" revolves around the heart-broken author, who is down and out in Paris.  His life entails bumming enough money to score food, women and a place to sleep.  Naturally, as a down and outer, he constantly complains about the system without ever having the guts to do anything about it.  I was really surprised that his character never did anything given his vitriolic nihilism towards just about everything.  The irony of the character is that despite hating society and everything in it, he must beg in order to exist in it.  I would have never guessed that Miller was such a chicken anarchist.<br /><br />This book won its mark of importance because of its symbol of freedom of speech and I am fine with that, but it just felt a little contrived the way he threw around the C word and his degradation of women.  There are only so many ways to describe cold-hearted sex and after you get the idea, Miller, if it is autobiographical, keeps on bragging.<br /><br />There were many times I felt like I was reading \\"On the Road\\", but without all of the good times and the passion.  They both have a strong counter culture current, but OTR is down and happy while TOC is down and miserable.  If you have to pick one, go with OTR.  I would much rather hang out, philosophize, party and travel with JK than HM.	2005-10-11

I frequently read entire books on The Beatles just to learn a single fact about the boys that I did not already know.  This book was, cover to cover, packed with new anecdotes and stories with which I was unfamiliar.  Bramwell's accounts are warm and frank.  This book is also, after years of indecision, and along with Pete Shotton's, the book that finally convinced me that Yoko Ono was not only the disruptive force that split the Beatles but also an out and out evil woman.  I loved every page of this book and read it slowly to savor the experience.	2005-10-11

She goes on the explain a little bit about the ideal Satanic figure, but for the most part it deals with how the pre-Christian Jews first labeled Greeks and Romans as \\"devils\\", then how the early Christians refered to Jews as such after the crucifiction of Christ, then Christians calling Romans \\"Satan\\" and so on and so forth. It basically dissects the meaning and usage of the word \\"Satan\\". Ms.Pagels has done her homework and presents us with a very engaging and enjoyable read. Highly recommended!	2005-10-11

Although I didn't have any wrinkles, I did notice that my skin looked slack, lacked vitality and I had to wear more makeup just to keep from looking tired.  I tried every beauty product on the market, but nothing seemed to help. I stumbled across Facercise while browsing through the health and beauty section of my local bookstore. It seemed interesting so I bought it. I began to do the exercises immediately, eager to regain some of the youthfulness my skin had obviously lost. My friends and family thought I was insane. They would laugh at all the crazy faces I would make while doing my Facercises. But after a few weeks, no one was laughing any more. My skin looked radiant and alive. These exercises even gave my skin a healthy pink glow. Just like when I was in my twenties.  <br /> <br />That was 6 years ago and I am thrilled to say that I look pretty much the same. No, that's not true. I look better. I am 36 years old and am continually mistaken for 26. My skin has no wrinkles, no signs of sagging. It just looks beautiful. I will continue to do these exercises for the rest of my life. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to look younger without having to resort to plastic surgery or harsh chemical peels. The results are nothing short of incredible. Thank you Carole Maggio for your wonderful book.  <br /> <br />Michelle Locke,  Charlotte, NC <br />	2005-10-11

It's always a delight to find an author who creates characters in three dimensions instead of the more usual two; Morgan seems to stretch his people to five or six. This is the third novel in the series about Takeshi Kovacs, ex-Envoy, stone killer, freelance renegade, and very dangerous man to be on the wrong side of. It's been three centuries, objective time, and Kovacs is back on Harlan's World, where he originally came from. It's also been a couple of centuries since the Resettlement, the failed Quellist revolution that gave the Harlan family oligarchy a run for its money, and Kovacs -- who only wants to continue killing fundamentalist priests (it's personal) -- finds himself caught up, first, in the attempt to reclaim the nanoware-drenched continent the revolution produced, and, later, in a new revolutionary plot. Because it's part of Quell's teachings, that when things go against you, you retreat and you wait -- for generations, if necessary. But now, just maybe, Quellquist Falconer might be back, in the flesh. But that's just this novel's top-level plot. There's also Kovacs's vendetta against those who let die the only woman who mattered to him -- Real Death, no resleeving. And there's his longstanding relationships with the several criminal cultures of Harlan's World, and with his old Envoy trainer. Not to even mention being hunted by a younger, smart-assed version of himself. And, just out of sight, there are the vanished Martians, about whom we learned a lot in Morgan's second book, Broken Angels. There's military and political philosophy here, all of it cynical, there's imaginative anthropology, there's a certain amount of gruff sex, there are some great quotes, there's considerable death (some deserved, some not), and there are breath-grabbing battle scenes like you haven't read in years. Morgan's second Kovacs novel was twice as good as his first. This one is three times as good as his second. If this one doesn't win both the Hugo and the Nebula, there's no justice. But, hey -- Kovacs already knows that.<br /><br />PS -- I was astonished a previous reviewer compared this to Bester's _The Stars My Destination_. A great book, don't get me wrong (I even own a First Edition copy of it), but Gully Foyle is pretty and pale and poetic beside the dark and blistering Takeshi Kovacs!no justice.

A chess miniature is a short game, generally 25 moves/countermoves or less.  These are not the kinds of games that many grandmasters play, but they are very useful and instructive for those who wish to play chess both on an amateur and a professional level.<br /><br />According to authors Leonard Barden and Wolfgang Heidenfeld, 'the development of modern chess is toward ever sharper and more aggressive lines of play, in contrast to the quiet scientific style preferred by the grandmasters of the thirties and early forties.'  This book was written in the 1950s, and incorporates games from the 40's and 50's, as well as key games and strategies from earlier times that fit the criterion of being a miniature.<br /><br />This book contains the full play of many games, delineated in move-by-move summary charts as well as commentary by the authors at critical junctures in the game.  There are charts that show the distribution of pieces on the board, to help the reader visualise the games.<br /><br />This book does assume some familiarity with chess, including some of the key games and conventions of commentary.  For example, on game two (Hiedenfeld-Zietemann, Berlin 1929), the authors make the commentary 'Black avoids the torrential waters of the Max Lange Attack proper, which continues with P x P.'  This one sentence shows the complexity and the humour in this text.<br /><br />One thing I like about the commentaries in on games in this text is that there are alternatives presented.  When there is a pivotal point in the game, the authors show how a different move might have resulted in a different game and outcome - of course, such is speculation to a certain extent, but following regular patterns of chess, these outcomes are interesting.<br /><br />There are over 160 presented here, including an appendix of games played after the primary typeset of the book.  Chess continues to develop, but like many enterprises, knowing the past and learning key ideas from the past can only strengthen the competitor in the future.nues to develop, but like many enterprises, knowing the past and learning key ideas from the past can only strengthen the competitor in the future.	2005-10-11

Globalization, an unstoppable force for both good and ill, has destroyed any possibility of American isolationism.  In spite of overwhelming military might, The United States cannot control the world.  In his final chapter \\"The Pitfalls of Power\\", Patwant Singh gives us a unique view of ourselves.

These homes are primarily older (as much as 300 years) that have been seriously redecorated to make them into jewels of plesant styling.  <br /> <br />For the most part, the redecoration of the homes has been to retain (or return to) the styling of the time they were built. Magnificant old beams show off well with modern appliances and decorations. The traditional outside of the houses hides the modern interiors. The original builders could not have imagined things we take for granted such as electricity that now has been fitted into their houses.  <br /> <br />Redoing an old house is easily as expensive as modern construction, so these houses have not been done for cost savings but for  other reasons like living in a part of history.  <br /> <br />While this book concentrates on this region of France, many of the techniques used in these houses could well be applied to houses in the United States where old houses be they farm or city center can be made into something unique and wonderful.	2005-10-11

He is a very good polemicist, both insightful and entertaining.      I found the chapter about Islam to be the weakest, and not because it was picking on that religion unfairly.  First, it seemed out of context, given the focus of the rest of the book on the United States, and second his view of the west seemed to change in that chapter and it threw me off.  In this chapter, the irrationality of Islam is not viewed in the context of the irrationality of Christianity, but in the context of the rationality of western secular liberalism.  So, rather than saying that the whole world is going crazy and that there is a real problem when you have two major forms of irrationality competing for dominance, that chapter makes us look really good in comparison.    Which, of course, we may . . . but that isn't the thrust of the book.    Harris buried a lot of his more technical arguments in the footnotes -- many of which are wonderful little essays in themselves -- leaving the body of the text as an informed look at this problem rather than an overly academic one.  And the look Harris takes is one which dares to question religion . . . an increasingly rare piece of courage in this country.    Harris is the only person I know of to write about ethics and morality without reference to intentions, thus denying a distinction between torture and accidents.  He gets transparently politicial in a few sections of this book, and you can see the quality of his reasoning change.	2005-10-11

I find it hilarious when they refer to their holier-than-thou Hugh Nibley? Who was Hugh Nibley outside of Utah? He was NOBODY! No real scholars outside the Mormon Church ever took him seriously. As for the people who really want to find out a little more about the Mormon corporation, I recommend the book \\"Leaving the Saints\\" by Hugh Nibley's daughter. In that book she explains in details what kind of man he was (he was one of those men who rape their daughters!). Furthermore, it is a very well written book - a real page turner! <br />Fawn M. Brodie's book is very well researched and has been acclaimed by scholars throughout the world. She was a real Professor, who worked for a real university. She was not one of those puppets who teach at BYU. Joseph Smith was a sick man and there are tons of documents that prove it.  <br />The Mormon Church was founded to make easy money and it still does today. Why do you think that the Mormon missionaries are instructed to wait until the last minute to talk to their prospective converts about the law of tithing (giving 10% of your income to the Mormon corporation)? I feel bad for its members and I pray God that he may bless them. <br />	2005-10-11

Tyson who returns to his rural hometown of  Swamp Creek, Arkansas after a ten-year hiatus.  Tyson left behind an abusive father, emotionally detached mother, sullen older brother and a loving younger sister, Cynthia.  T.L. adored Cynthia and she was his reason for living and wanting something better than his humble, backwoods beginning.  It is because of his sister that he is now returning home after completing ten years of higher education and receiving a Ph.D. in Black Studies-which leaves his father wondering why he wasted good money on learning about Black Folks-when he could have told him everything he needed to know!  His sister,who was not even 10 when he left home,was his pride and joy, childhood friend, spiritual confidante and was his only reason for wanting to stay connected to folks who obviously had no commitment to him.  However, ten years is a long time to be gone and to have very little contact with family, so much to his surprise and chagrin, he learns upon returning home that his sister is gone-she died.  No one notified him of  her untimely death and no one wants to talk about it nor tell him how she died.<br /><br />In his tantrum and angry quest to find out what happened to Cynthia, T.L. will rip open the dysfunctional fabric that holds his family together.  He will discover that the glue that seals them together includes generational secrets, incest,  adultery, emotional annihilation and self-hatred.  Going home will also bring him face to face with his favorite teacher who is dying and who has a few secrets of her own.  She also has a demanding request of T. L. that he is not sure that he can honor. Since returning home, the baggage of the past is suffocating him and stifling his reason for being-and now that his sister is gone he is in more of a hurry to return to his beloved NYC.  But can one ever really emotionally or physically leave the place they call home?<br /><br />They Tell Me of a Home is a powerful, universal story of a young man returning home and coming to the realization that  \\" my coming home was because I had missed the most critical lesson any student can learn-that transforming the world begins with love of one's own people.\\"  Black delivers a poignant message as we journey with T.L. and he discovers that just maybe being from Swamp Creek isn't so bad and drives home  an even greater message that many folks of color still need to hear today-\\" that until we teach ourselves, we will always hate ourselves' -and continue to run away from the situation rather than to deal with what ails us.<br /><br /> Filled with wit, wisdom, social messages, folklore and rural southern black folk and their ways, Tyson's debut novel is creatively crafted and a page-turner.  Beautifully and lyrically written, colorful characters including secondary characters that felt like family and  inclusion of my two favorite topics-African American History and religion quickly moved this read into my Top 10 for 2005.  Anyone who has ever spent time in the South or still has family there will identify with at least one of the characters in the story.  They remind us of folks that we would  not choose if given a choice but because of blood relations these are the same folks that we lovingly and sometimes grudgingly call family.  I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a refreshing and wonderfully crafted story featuring an African American male  protagonist who endearingly worms his way into our hearts and leaves a few unforgettable gems of nuggets for us to chew on-as only a Southerner can do!<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClubave the place they call home?  <br /> <br />They Tell Me of a Home is a powerful, universal story of a young man returning home and coming to the realization that  \\" my coming home was because I had missed the most critical lesson any student can learn-that transforming the world begins with love of one's own people.\\"  Black delivers a poignant message as we journey with T.L. and he discovers that just maybe being from Swamp Creek isn't so bad and drives home  an even greater message that many folks of color still need to hear today-\\" that until we teach ourselves, we will always hate ourselves' -and continue to run away from the situation rather than to deal with what ails us.  <br /> <br /> Filled with wit, wisdom, social messages, folklore and rural southern black folk and their ways, Tyson's debut novel is creatively crafted and a page-turner.

Some reviewers have called this book hard to put down, a page-turner. I found it so. Part of its interest lies in Brahms himself; any book that purports to shed even a bit of light on so enigmatic a figure would cause one to turn pages in hopes of illumination. But I can imagine, too, a very dull book about Brahms. Well, there are few dull pages among the 600+ in Swafford's biography. As is now de rigueur in good modern historical writing, Swafford creates a judicious blend of primary-source material and commentary thereon, along with a rich store of anecdotes told in his own fine, writerly voice.    Musical analysis is treated in such a way that the amateur musician, and even the musically challenged, will not be put off. In all cases, Swafford demonstrates well one of his chief theses--that Brahms was the most Janus-like of the great nineteenth century composers. He looked back all the way to Renaissance masters, assimilating their contrapuntal styles in ways beyond anything that Beethoven, Mendelssohn, or Schumann had done before him. Yet he so thoroughly anticipated the ambiguity of tonality and rhythm in twentieth-century music that Schoenberg could, long after Brahms's death, speak of \\"Brahms the Progressive.\\"    But there is much more than musical analysis in this book. There is a thorough investigation of the many dualities in Brahms's nature: Brahms the generous, Brahms the curmudgeonly; Brahms the respecter of (intellectual and artistic) women, Brahms the misogynist; Brahms the romantic, Brahms the classicist; Brahms the sentimentalist, Brahms the cynic; Brahms the self-effacing, Brahms the monumentally egotistical. Swafford presents them all in their staggering incompatibility. And while Swafford himself admits that no one can ever quite hope to reconcile all these manifestations or indeed fill in the gaps in a life that the composer himself hoped to keep mostly a closed book, he comes close to making this great study in contrasts that was Brahms into a flesh-and-blood individual whose most mystifying acts seem almost comprehensible because we have seen him in action in similar contexts. By an exhaustive examination of the primary literature and shrewd speculation based thereon, Swafford builds a picture that convinces. He can't make us always like Brahms or even sympathize with him, but we come to understand him better through Swafford's portrait than we ever thought we could. That is some accomplishment.    Beyond this are the passages in which Swafford speaks of musical and indeed cultural history after Brahms. The epilogue to this book, in which the author traces Brahms's paradoxical legacy through the great century of change since his death, should be mandatory reading for all students of culture in the West.    Are there flaws? Yes. Some parts of the book show haste while others show careful crafting. In a work this large, that is to be expected. And Swafford overuses the word \\"magisterial.\\" This may describe Brahms to a tee, but so, I hope, do a few other adjectives. Small gripes? Small indeed, given the wealth of insight and reading pleasure that Swafford provides here. I'm ready for his biography of Ives!	2005-10-11

Mainly, they blow stuff up and wreck machines, but they have a fun time doing it.<br />In \\"Hayduke Lives!,\\" the sequel to that book, Edward Abbey returns to those characters and tries to stir them up to action once again, this time with the threat of a giant bulldozer about to destroy a beautiful canyon.<br />Yeah....<br />First of all, do not read this until you've read \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" first.  And even then, think about it carefully before reading this half-formed, rambling, disappointing sequel.<br />I loved \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\"--I've read it multiple times--and so the first fifty pages or so of this were just a lot fun to me, being reunited with the characters from that book.<br />But then, the story never really goes anywhere.  The novel constantly digresses to describe sex scenes or Earth First! rallies, and it's not until page 270(!) of a 307-page novel that the four original members of the Monkey Wrench Gang finally reunite.<br />The book rambles on in an unfocused way that damages the characters that were so nicely formed in the first book, constantly digresses, and ultimately, unfortunately, becomes much more violent than \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" ever did.<br />The writing is occassionally good--sometimes even great--and some of the scenes are exciting, but none of it ever goes anywhere.  There are too many characters and not enough character development, and the whole thing with the bulldozer comes across as lame and cheesy, especially when the first book set up their next goal to be something much bigger and more exciting--the destruction of Glen Canyon Dam.<br />Read this only if you absolutely LOVED \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang,\\" but even then, be warned that this might dampen your enthusiasm even for that book.  It's pretty disappointing, especially coming from an author that we all know was capable of much, much better.le of much, much better.	2005-10-11

Nye explores how electricity changed the home (it was now cleaner and safer than gas), the factory, and transportation (it made the subway and inter-urban trolley-car systems possible). Americans embraced this new source of energy quickly and convincingly. The mantra, however, that electric appliances would free the housewife was not true: men did not take to the appliances as readily and (surprise!) women suddenly were doing chores (vacuuming) that men used to do (beat the rugs). There is a lot of detail in the book, but not much that is new or not obvious. For that reason it was somewhat dull.	2005-10-11

Another title for this review could have been \\"Risky business\\".  It is the intriguing tale of a woman who has lived on the edge for most of her life, and who has experienced things you and I would never want to imagine.<br /><br />In a life story that the National Enquirer would have been proud to scoop, a headstrong and determined young woman named Yvonne Shilkin went against the tide, first carving a niche for herself as a singer, (a white, Australian Aretha Franklin), giving up that dream by refusing to compromise on her principles, marrying the man her mother warned her about, enduring a divorce from hell, witnessing the murder of her fianc&eacute;, and then finding love with a wonderful man, only to be kidnapped for eleven horrible days in Russia as a result of the couple's very lucrative but risky business ventures as barter/trade agents.<br /><br />Unknowingly and perhaps naively putting their eggs in the same basket with criminals and thugs, the couple's ordeal only came to a relatively happy ending thanks to a series of fortunate events, some dependable friends, a brilliant and well connected Russian lawyer and a sympathetic, ambitious and competent Russian Colonel.<br /><br />I say relatively happy, because the ordeal has had lasting effects on the author, leading to divorce, fear of victimization from the largely unpunished perpetrators, and financial ruin.<br /><br />On the other hand, the fat lady hasn't sung, and the story hasn't ended.  The author has since pulled herself together financially, found happiness with the soul mate she waited over forty years to find, and is now living with her extended family in the United States.<br /><br />This true story is simply told, and although the most brutal parts are not graphically described, what we are told is more than enough to understand the meaning of Primo Levi's words, \\"I am constantly amazed by man's inhumanity to man.\\"<br /><br />Rated 4.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 11, 20052005 <br />	2005-10-11

Martin proves, once again, just-how-talented and versatile he is within the performing arts -- having moved from comedian to actor and now to a fiction writer, he's simply a pleasure to read (and to hear) as he so expertly portrays a young, depressed woman in her almost desperate search for the wrong kind of love.  As depressing a story as this may be overall, it's simply great to see the talent and words from source an almost unexpected source... definitely a recommendation, I'd encourage those with the time to pursue Martin's own unabridged reading on CD, as I can imagine it only further adds to a very good story.	2005-10-11

Review of The Heart of Whiteness<br /><br />For those who choose to take the trip, Professor Jensen has charted a course, in plain English, and with few pretensions, to fuller understanding of the depth of the scars that American racism has left on our humanity.  It has infected our individual and collective psyches with a disease that is difficult to overcome: the disease of color prejudice, white privilege, white supremacy, white superiority, and white racism.<br /><br />In the same vein as that of Lillian Smith's \\"Killing the Dream;\\" or Tim Wise's \\"White Like Me;\\" or indeed with the same skill and moving passion as the F. H. Griffith classic, \\"Black Like Me,\\" professor Jensen has used his own life experience, and his considerable intellectual skills to shake not just the white conscience, but the conscience of America.  And while he cannot be blamed for not solving all the problems he raised, we must all be grateful to him for having the courage to raise them, and for doing so in such a clear-minded, passionate and committed manner.<br /><br />In this short volume, the University of Texas at Austin Professor, Robert Jensen, has demonstrated that he has acquired the necessary self-knowledge (the escape velocity needed to propel himself beyond the orbit of \\"naÃ¯ve white supremacy\\" into the orbit of \\"fully self-conscious white supremacy\\") to break away from the comforts of white privilege.  This is an important and necessary, but as he so eloquently noted, an insufficient step on the road to overcoming the disease of white privilege, and its larger manifestation, American style white racism.<br /><br />Jensen has let the cat out of the bag: White humanity is just short of a fraud built on the quicksand of propped up privileges, unfair advantages, unjust prerogatives, structural injustices, four-century-old myths, four centuries of violence and genocide, and lies, all insulated and protected by a system of soft tyranny and spatial Apartheid.  In short, if one understands Jensen correctly, America has sacrificed all of the little humanity it has, on the altar of skin color superiority.<br /><br />As Jensen has discovered, in this his much-needed second thrust -- re-entering the old orbit of white supremacy armed with self-knowledge -- is a much trickier step than being a content, \\"naÃ¯ve white supremacist.\\"  For, as the author has discovered, the invisible power of systemic racial hegemony is the ultimate goal, and the real name of the game of white supremacy.<br /><br />Jensen makes clear a truism seldom recognized: that American racism is no longer personal.  It no longer matters how many committed anti-racists we can summon to a given cause; or who hates or does not hate blacks; or how many skinheads roam the streets, the anti-racists cannot acquire (nor will they ever constitute) a critical mass in American society.<br /><br />The consolidation and preservation of white privilege through systemic racist power is self-defining, self-promoting, and now all but a self-regulating and self-sustaining process.  There is no longer a need to consolidate white privilege, for there can be no better consolidation than having it built in to all the structures of American power.  Destroying white privilege, on the other hand, represents a \\"clear and present danger\\" to American Society as we know it.  Taking Jensen's arguments to their logical conclusions, white identity, the very basis of white self-esteem, and white humanity are all built on the sand castle of exaggerated heroics, violence and color myths -- enforced meanings that favor puffed up interpretations of white history, and the de-valuing and denigration of blacks and other non-white peoples contributions.<br /><br />As is implicit in this brief but deeply moving confessional, if one looks deeply enough, one will discover that systemic racism transcends and thus resists all attempts at re-adjustments designed to overcome its negative aspects.  It has evolved in such a manner that it now can be seen to operate on autopilot: The laws of American social physics and of American racist power mechanics are simple and virtually immutable.  They dictate that there can be no absolute black progress relative to whites; that is, that the racist system must remain in a virtual steady-state: Black progress must ALWAYS be compensated for with equal and offsetting amounts of white progress, otherwise whites become agitated and uncomfortable.<br /><br />It is consider bad sport to attempt to close the absolute distance between the races -- either socially, economically, or politically.  Power is the name of the game.  As Jensen makes clear, it hardly matters any more what individuals on either side of the racial divide do:  The script of the drama has been written, signed, and sealed through the interlocking mechanisms of racist power: lockstep, we all have learned to play out to the last letter, our respective ascribed roles.  No deviations are allowed.<br /><br />To step outside the racist norm as Dr. Jensen has done, is to be considered a \\"race traitor,\\" and to be brutally jerked back in line and reminded that America's benign and soft racist totalitarianism is neither benign, nor soft.  And, in the end, although everything is designed to look different on the surface, taking on different textures and colors, depending on the angle, the brutal fact remains that all power alignments are fixed, immutable and must stay exactly the same -- consolidated under the insulated and ever-protective umbrella of white supremacist hegemony.<br /><br />Put yet another way, in the end, and at a much deeper level, all moves on the American chessboard have been pre-determined to promote, enable, and consolidate the \\"ways of white power,\\" and the \\"ways of white supremacy.\\" Whether it be of the \\"naÃ¯ve\\" or of the \\"profoundly self-conscious\\" white supremacist sort that Professor Jensen exhibits, is really of little or no consequence.<br /><br />As Jensen alludes to himself:by making a virtue out of emerging demographic and moral necessity, the white supremacists have used their favorite unconscious (conscious) tactic: that of redefining and renaming racial discrepancies - this time as multiculturalism  and racial and cultural diversity -- and realigning minority interests so that they look much like the chauvinistic white supremacist imperatives they are allowed to mimic.<br /><br />Once meaning has been drained, redefined, refilled and then realigned, white supremacy is then put firmly back on track; the challenge has been averted, successfully squashed: everything can then be returned to normal but with a different cosmetic look, made to look different (even positive) while at the same time remaining exactly the same.  This \\"co-optation through redefinition and re-incorporation\\" is the newest systemic way of deflecting all new challenges to racist hegemony.<br /><br />No matter what the moves are on the American chessboard, white supremacy remains the same old Black Hole that it always has been: a closed insular mean-spirited, evil, structurally violent system from which nothing enters or escapes that does not get altered to promote, consolidate, or enable \\"the ways of racism.\\"  In the end, we are all Condoleeza Rices and Clarence Thomas': closet white supremacists, pretending that we do not know how we are being used to advance the evils of a bankrupt system.<br /><br />Jensen makes clear that racism, as expressed through the insular world of white privilege, is the gravity that holds the whole stinking system of white supremacy together.  The idea that there may yet be an anti-racist world \\"out there\\" somewhere where whites will someday voluntarily give up their power and privileges is fanciful and a highly theoretical notion that may in the end be just another illusion, or mirage (like real multiculturalism is).<br /><br />No one has yet seen, inhabited, or can even describe the steps needed to get to such a world.  And while Professor Jensen has made a heroic effort to push us out of our comfort zones -- to the frontiers of a new kind of non-racist thinking and understanding -- in the end even he admits that this will not crack the nut at the center of this peculiar American disease.  Even self-conscious white supremacy is perhaps too little, too late.  He of course cannot be blamed for this.<br /><br />What then to do?<br /><br />Even though everyone seems to understand that systemic problems cannot be solved at non-systemic levels of analysis -- that is, beneath the system as a whole -- they nevertheless seem more comfortable attacking problems of racism at these lower inherently ineffectual levels (at the community and interpersonal levels, for instance) rather than at the national level.  I think this is a strategic as well as a systemic mistake.<br /><br />If we stopped only for a moment to think, we would realize that if any of the laws we have on the books regarding racism were ever to be enforced to the letter, without deviation, racism in America would soon wither away. And, there would be no need to have to re-enact the same ineffectual laws over and over again.  \\"Paper or legal equality\\" does not work because it is not worth the paper it is written on, and that includes the U.S. Constitution.  The failure to enforce a law, over time makes it a \\"dead letter,\\" an inert symbolic fraud, like the flawed white humanity that has been used to underwrite it.<br /><br />When will whites begin to understand, that it is not just a \\"lack of progress\\" to fail to enforce the Constitution, it is a sharp stab in the heart of American humanity; it renders the Constitution a \\"dead letter,\\" a paper fraud.<br /><br />Thus, the first step we need to take is to plug the holes between democratic theory and everyday American practice; between our stated ideals, which sit on pedestals to be lauded as they collect dust, and our everyday American practice.  If disincentives were built-in to discourage this kind of leakage, we could solve the problems of racism over night.  No need for Affirmative Action or grand theorizing or any other special programs.  The Constitution either has what is needed, and thus embodies the meaning it was intended to have; or it has been commandeered by racists for a different meaning, and for entirely different purposes. It cannot be both; whites cannot have their cake and eat it too.<br /><br />When black people have confidence that the playing field is fair, they come out of their shell of disgrace and self-destructive behavior to excel.  In fact, there is no evidence to the contrary.  Likewise, when whites see fairness over the horizon, they begin, almost instinctively and always unconsciously, to back up like crabs looking for a place to hide, ways to cut corners; in search of angles to play and advantages, privileges, prerogatives, and offsets to use to give themselves an edge.  Just as blacks seem to thrive in environments of fairness, whites seem to fear them.<br /><br />Enforcing laws TO THE TEE is a simple systemic ways of building the proper incentives into the system that promote and counteract these inherent tendencies.<br /><br />Professor Jensen sits at the top of my \\"must read\\" list.

The author splits the telling between two narrators and sets off one from the other with a clever trick. Irving puts Owen Meany's words in ALL CAPS while this author puts his main character's thoughts in italics. <br /> <br />It really works. <br /> <br />This book, like so many of Irving's, is all about perception and reality. A lot of people who have commented on this book have dwelled on the characters and how beautiful the story is. I agree, it is beautiful, but the writing is the real star to me. It is great.  <br /> <br />Usually, I can spot a narrative trick and figure out a plot line with little trouble. \\"The Poet of Loch Ness\\" had me guessing and second-guessing (and third-guessing!) right to the end and still managed to surprise me not once but twice. Ladies, that's writing. <br /> <br />I teach a creative writing course, and my students will be reading and studying this book next semester. I have found another writer like John Irving, one that actually knows how to write!	2005-10-11

I continue to find this book an excellent resource for my own practice as a psychotherapist. It's importance derives from the clarity and sincerity of the author's approach to his own patients, which he shares with the reader. Through both expository writing and many case studies Levenkron explains the motivation for those who despair of help from others and turn their anger and sadness on themselves.<br /><br />I have used the theory in this book, combined with my own experience, to successfully help in the recovery of men and women of varied ages and situations. There is a down-to-earth quality in this book that makes it accessible to every reader. In fact three of my patients in the last year brought in their copies of Cutting, with highlit passages that they found helpful.<br /><br />Self-harm is very difficult to treat unless properly understood and many of my colleagues have declined to work with people who cut, burn, or otherwise harm themselves, feeling that this behavior is a sign of suicidal intention or incurable psychosis. My hope is that books like \\"Cutting\\" will build a broad base of therapists who feel familiar and enthusiastic about treating this disorder, which causes sufferers to feel so much pain and shame.<br /><br />I've noticed some very negative comments about this book. As a counselor, I hope these irresponsible and strangely personal \\"basher\\" reviews will not discourage those who can benefit from this and other books by Steven Levenkron.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Cutting\\" to anyone who suffers with this disorder, their families, and their therapists as an easy to read and thorough approach to this topic.	2005-10-11

I respect the art of writing to such an extent that it is unthinkable for me to stop reading a book without finishing it, no matter how I feel about it.  As far as I'm concerned, it's an insult to the author that dedicated so much time and effort to their art.  That said: I really, really, tried to finish this book, especially since I loved the idea of an urban Buffy like character. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Damali and Carlos were the most irresponsible, reckless, self centered, irrational, egotistical, undisciplined characters I have ever read - and I couldn't stand them. <br /> <br />OK, Carlos being an arrogant jerk is acceptable - though Damali's blind attraction to such a creature boggles my mind.  The sexual irresponsibility of the millennium Neteru, trusted with protecting the world from Armageddon made her character unredeemable.   <br /> <br />I made it through almost 3/4 of the book by fast forwarding through the terribly drawn out, disturbing sex scenes where the Neteru kept getting voluntarily bitten so that they could reach sexual heights that could only be achieved by siphoning each other.  This reckless quest for gratification was so much more significant than the risk of being turned into a vampire permanently, the future of humanity or the Guardians that exist only to protect her.   <br /> <br />To make matters worse, they just wouldn't stop!  The only thing that would have made me finish this book would be if the Guardians staked them both.   <br />	2005-10-11

The Runaway Angels by Ramona Cleofas-Moore has brought me to a new level regarding my reading habits.  Her first chapter about the Kingdom of Heaven and the powers of the two angels, Mark and Leslie, made me wonder about the unknown world, made me wonder the perfection of life where the two angels came from.  Do they have the powers to do miracles which the author has revealed in the book?  Though I don't really buy the idea of angels too much, I found the book pretty delightful and interesting to read.  It carried a wholesome message and unbelievable miracles that referred to the status of this crazy world.  The Runaway Angels is a breath of fresh air, away from the gory topics you can find in most of the bookstore shelves. Hear me everyone, this is something your kids must read. Oh, I take that back, it is the book YOU and your kids must read.  I read it twice, and I laugh at the parts where it tickles my bones.	2005-10-11

I still remember impressive parts of this book - such as the discussion of Lear's senility - while none of the other titles made such a lasting impression. <br /> <br />As I could not find my old copy, I came to Amazon to reorder it and found two brief, scathing reviews on the web page. I consider them grossly unfair. Greer's text is admittedly a bit harder going that some others in the series, but it repays close reading. Somehow the Oxford editor let this one through without the usual brutal editing that makes the prose almost as easy to read as journalistic writing. The book  is simply not as \\"introductory\\" as others in the series, and I would not recommend it to anyone who has not already read the major plays. <br /> <br />Greer is most famed as a feminist, of course, but this text is not burdened with irrelevant gender politics (as, say, Julia Annas' book on Plato in the same series is). Greer's points on gender in this book are measured, thoughtful and surprising. She starts out with the central point that younger, humorless feminists have missed: That Shakespeare in his way adored women. I have read scores of recent Shakespeare editions in the Oxford, Cambridge and Arden 3 series, and this is one of the few discussions of gender in Shakespeare that I have found to be worth reading. (The worst discussions are the ones written by male authors who seem to believe that they need to insert a section on gender whether or not it is relevant to the play. Cf. the recent Oxford edition of Timon of Athens for an egregious example.) <br /> <br />For all that, most readers will find Greer's analyses of the major plays the high point of the book.	2005-10-11

Sometimes it also seemed like if the author was told anything she felt was interesting by the twins she studied, she wanted to quote them exactly on it, even when the quote didn't really make total sense without the whole conversation being there.<br /><br />But these are quibbles---I just liked the information and the tone of the author so much I wish that the book was a bit more cohesive so even more people would get through it and gain the knowledge it holds!

Forged in the challenging world of publisher marketing, the concept of this book is built around the metaphor of starting a fire. Stielstra starts by pointing out the need to isolate the group of consumers most likely to buy. He calls this primary target audience the \\"driest tinder.\\" Then, instead of spreading your marketing funds broadly, he encourages you to focus your marketing resources on this group (touch them with the match) by giving them a product experience. Then, you \\"fan the flames\\" of their enthusiasm by enabling these consumers to become product evangelists. Finally, you collect the consumer data (save the coals) so that the next time you want to communicate with this audience, you can do it effiently.<br /><br />I read a lot of marketing books. Some are full of philosophical fluff. This one is extremely practical. As technology continues to advance, it will confirm the brilliance of Stielstra's approach by enabling us to follow his advice more cost-effectively.

I was disappointed in this book.  <br /> <br />I found that the author introduced some interesting historical facts and then failed to follow through on these in favour of a more simplistic storyline. For instance, Elisabeth is chosen by the Emperor over her older and(arguably more suitable) sister, to be his wife. This is something I would have liked explored. The strain some of the realities of royality puts upon regular family roles. Yet, the author glances over this and has Elisabeth focus on more mundane and stereotypical things like fashion and her weight.  <br /> <br />A second storyline, only hinted at in the book, is the hypocritical stand of the Emperor's mother towards her future daughter-in-law. Since this woman also played a domineering and cruel role in Elisabeth's future (rearing her grandchildren in place of Elisabeth and even naming the grandchildren, this would have been an interesting story.  <br /> <br />What I like most about the Royal Diaries series is that these books tell us about the privileges and responsibilities of princesses. It is easy for young girls to imagine princesses have it easy but these diaries demonstrate that this is not always true: while princesses typically live a life of luxury, they also have to live up to (and under) royal responsibilities.  <br /> <br />I think Elisabeth of Hungary had a better story to tell in the royal diaries rather than the trite, stereotyped nonsense that this author settled for! As I said, I was disappointed. <br /> <br />Karen	2005-10-11

Perloff's Shadows of Power is a fact based account of the real power behind the American political system. The CFR (Council on Foriegn Relations), an invitation only organization, is the North American sister organization of the RIIA (Royal Institute of International Affairs). The CFR, with David C. Rockefeller as it's Honorary Chairman, permeates the highest levels of government (Current members include Dick Cheney, Condaleeza Rice, Teddy Kennedy, Bill Frist, Colin Powell, Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, Henry Kissinger, John McCain, John Kerry and the list goes on and on). Media organizations and their highest ups like Rupert Murdoch, Catherine Graham (Washington Post) and all of his media empire (Fox News etc.) as well as reporters like Barbara Walters etc. are also members. And as Perloff makes clear, the organizations goal is to create a one world elitist government. <br /> <br />Once you read and digest the facts that Perloff presents in an orderly fashion, it becomes clear that we are being led down a primrose path by a group of insiders connected to the international banking community and very high level power brokers who keep a low profile and operate in the shadows (Hence, shadows of power.). <br /> <br />This book is not about Conspiracy Theory. It is about Conspiracy facts. If you want to peek behind the curtain of power or can't make sense of the moves of our politicians, this book will begin to clear the haze of confusion for you. <br />  <br />I would also recommend a companion book by John McManus- The Insiders which provides a current list of CFR members. Good overview of the CFR and Tri Lateral Commission that takes you through each Presidency since Carter and traces the CFR members and their moves. It also provides a list of current members which serves as a nice reference while watching TV, etc. Once you understand the motives of this organization, it allows you to see through the hidden messages being conveyed by the media and through current legislation. <br /> <br />I would also suggest 2 books that will significantly clarify the power of economic control and how it is being used to control our lives. One is Edward G. Griffins- The Creature from Jekyll Island which is about the orgin and operations of the Federal Reserve System. (Not Federal, has no reserves and is a cartel of private banks not a system.) Reading this book is like taking the blue pill instead of the red one as was offered to Neo in the first matrix movie. You will never again look at our government in the same way. Again based upon well documented fact, not theory. <br /> <br />The second book is again from John McManus entitled Financial Terrorism and it is also a fact based book on money and economics that is a clearly written yet easily understood (as is Griffins book) expose of how our money system has been corrupted into the hands of internation bankers and power brokers. <br /> <br />There are more, but if you read these 4 books you will be light years ahead of most private citizens in their understanding of what is really going on in out lives and reality and less easily led down a primrose path by the power elites. <br /> <br />Finally, for a sample dose of reality go to [...] and read the article Abolishing the USA, follow the links to the government site on the SPP (Security and Prosperity Partnership for America) and keep an open mind. See for yourself that this stuff is happening before our very eyes while we are asleep at the wheel naively allowing our liberties and prosperity to be stolen away by a ruthless group of power elites who only goal is total dominance, power and control over all of humanity. <br /> <br />Please read the books, reflect and help out before our way of life disappears forever and is replaced by a 1984-like reality.  <br />	2005-10-11

I imagine it's long out of print, but I had to pick it up since I've always been a big fan of Larry Robinson. <br /> <br />This is a typical sports autobiography, not well written (not everyone can be Ken Dryden), but still entertaining.  I really enjoyed reading about the Canadiens teams of the '70s and '80s and Robinson was one of the key contributors to those teams.  Not many players have won six Stanley Cups, but he is one of the few, so we get to hear what it was like from a first-person perspective.  I also enjoyed reading about some of the Canadiens then-future stars like Patrick Roy and Chris Chelios to see what a veteran teammate thought of them at the beginning of their careers.  Funny to read about Patrick Roy being initially inconsistent, although Robinson correctly predicted that he would be in the same class as Grant Fuhr and Billy Smith if he ironed out his inconsistency. <br /> <br />So for writing skill, this is probably only three stars, but for content I'd call it four or five stars and that's why my final rating is four stars.	2005-10-11

My 14 yr old (very picky reader) daughter was drawn to read this book by the cover. She had her Bat Mitzvah last year. Sometimes you CAN judge a book by its' cover. She read it constantly, even walking around the house and then told me I HAD to read it. I am glad I did as it is laugh out loud funny and true to the highs and lows of teenage emotions. Some events were definitely more (advanced) than my daughter has lived through, but the book exposed her to far less than a typical PG-13 movie. I highly recommend this book and plan to share it with other teenagers through our Temple library. Although we read the book from the post Bat Mitzvah stand point, this is a book that would appeal to anyone who is experiencing or has lived through that time of flucuating emotions and friendships that is so common to the teenage years. We loved it!	2005-10-11

It is really about the basic fundamentals that make any martial art work properly when you take your dojo skills on the street. This is good solid stuff, not particularly exciting, but absolutely essential, cerebral, and right on. The authors are highly skilled and their experience really resonates within these pages.<br /><br />As most long-term martial artists know, earning a black belt is really just the beginning of a practitioner's martial journey. Since obtaining mine I discovered that the more I know, the more I realize that the fundamentals are paramount. That's the focus of this book. The SWOT analysis is an important tool described herein. It stands for Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat, an invaluable tool for error detection as you place your techniques under a microscope. Essential nuances of structure, posture, body mechanics, and positioning are critical for success and well described herein. The writing is clear, articulate, and easy to follow. The highlighted practice hints are a nice addition too.<br /><br />My only complaint, which frankly is pretty minor, is that the pictures do not have very good contrast and there are harsh vertical lines on the wall in the background of many of them that make them a little challenging to view. Furthermore, there really are not enough photos to illuminate everything properly unless you've been practicing martial arts for a while and understand what the authors are talking about.<br /><br />There is a very short section on the purpose of weapons and weapons training and a brief overview of what happens when you utilize this knowledge in the real world but the vast majority of the materials are focused on getting the basics right. Topics covered include range, weight transfer, positioning, posture, placement, blocking, punching, stances, kicking, elbows, takedowns, and throws.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent and highly recommended book.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructionking, elbows, takedowns, and throws.

It's not for the petty at heart - people who constantly find fault in the things that don't matter.  It's not for people who feel nothing who are dead to their souls and couldn't be moved if a Mac Truck were behind them.  This book is for people who are humble enough to see themselves in the eyes of a young woman who has made poor choices as all of us have, yet because of a push here, encouragement there and finally making good choices finds herself with wonderful opportunities.  Read this book if you simply are hungry for a downhome chat with an extraordinary young woman.  Fantasia makes no excuses for her poor choices.  In a loving and encouraging way, she simply tries to encourage people to choose a different path.   <br /> <br />Fantasia, thanks for baring your soul in hopes of making a difference.

The pace picks up in this book.  This book adds more character development to Rapp and it does it in full, fast-paced form.  Rahn's character is dynamic enough to bring home the point that these assassins have what they do for a living, and that is about it.  I am glad Flynn decided not to expound greatly on the interactions between her and Rapp, there was just enough to bring her into the story.  The book starts off fast with Mitch on an operation in Germany...when things go wrong, Mitch goes looking for the reasons.  Assassins are all over the place in this one, and multiple government agencies are involved in an intricate plot.  Pull in Saddham Hussein, and you have one heck of a story.  The behind the scenes politician babble that Flynn provides is top notch.  It makes you start to look at your Senators and Representatives in different ways.  Try figuring out who might be like the characters in this novel.  I really liked this one, but reading the Third Option first is a must.	2005-10-11

These two iconic comics share the common trait of ending their runs while very popular.  The wonder of Calvin and Hobbes is that it distils truth and opinion so simply (through Calvin) and each of us can relate to him. The set is vert nicely done, with nice color artwork and very nice reproductions.  I don't have problems with editorial changes to a few comics. I don't see the harm in it in the least.  I do wish that Watterson had included some kind of commentary to go along with some of the comics, as he had in some of the compilation books. The insights in the introduction are good, but left me wanting more.  I still rate it 5 stars. Its great to have in my home. I think my family will enjoy it for many, many years.	2005-10-11

The chapters, written on such subjects as Alexandria's kings and queens, and Ptolemaic Art, are informative and accessable, but this book is no beginner's guide to Ptolemaic Egypt, and is very in-depth. While not a picture book, this work includes twenty six gorgeous and rare color photos. Though few, these pictures are extroadinary. The book contains dozens of wonderful black and white photos, and it seems that all the images and visuals in this book aren't simply there for their beauty (though they are amazing) and serve a purpose. Perhaps the best part of this book is the dozens of never-before seen maps and timelines, which help to give the reader a visual idea of time and chronology, as well as the layouts of some of the more important historical and archeological sites and monuments. Maps of Egypt, the Ptolemaic and Roman Empire, the Greek and Roman Provinces in Egypt, and important cities and trade routes are included, and are extremely helpful and important. This book is worth every penny of its 40 or so dollars. The best book I've encountered on the Greco-Roman Period of Egypt. I recommend this wonderful book to anyone interested in this fascinating time period.	2005-10-11

I envy those who loved this disappointing installment of an epic series.<br /><br />I adored all of the previous books in the Outlander series, and I even liked The Fiery Cross, unlike so many others.  But I have only read 100 pages of \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" and I am appalled.  I am not even sure I want to finish it and risk tarnishing my affection for all of Ms. Gabaldon's other tales.  SPOILERS ahead (though minor).<br /><br />What I find most disturbing is the crassness of the narrative and the apparant disregard for the history of the characters.<br /><br />SPOILERS:  The scene where Roger forces (albeit drunkenly) himself on Brianna - with Jem nestled sleeping at her side - and Brianna's response to it was astonishing.  Did \\"The Fiery Cross\\" not devote HUNDREDS of pages detailing the deep-seated emotional scars left by Stephen Bonnet's rape of Brianna????? Is this the same Roger who before always sensitively and tenderly restrained his lust in respect of her scars? Does this not matter to Roger anymore?  Does it no longer bother Brianna?  If so... HOW? WHY?  WHAT HAPPENED?<br /><br />And the late-night visit of the Cherokee girls to Jamie while he and Ian were visiting... Ian's amusement struck me as improbable, as did (devoutly Catholic and deeply committed)Jamie's decision to allow the naked girls to sleep with him.  Would Claire have been amused by this as well?  I don't think so.<br /><br />I assure you that I am no prude but it seems to me that in \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" Ms. Gabaldon has abandoned romance and passion for light porn; traded clever and seamless integration of historical events, time-travel and a truly remarkable fictional romance for crass dialogue and indifferent adventures; and worst of all... forsaken the integrity of the characters - as well as her own painstaking and tender work in building those characters - for sensationalistic filler material.<br /><br />On the other hand I have long dreaded the conclusion of this series and the necessity of saying goodbye to so many beloved characters... I should probably thank Ms. Gabaldon for making the transition so very easy.lusion of this series and the necessity of saying goodbye to so many beloved characters...

Sadly	The Rizzoli Contract is described as a literary thriller- literary both because it focuses deeply on what is taking place within Harry Donohue (its main character) and because the contract of the title is a book contract- not the contract put out on someone's life (as I had assumed, going in.)<br /><br />A good read? Yeah. But it would have been jazzed up by more hit men. More rocket launchers. And spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />Plot summary: a fifty-something Bostonian, failing to safeguard the family business which his siblings have entrusted to him, casts all his wits and strength into a make-or-break gamble. Can he turn Rizzoli's story into a bestseller that will revive the fortunes of Donohue Press? Can he keep his grubby old-man mitts of of Rizzoli's wife? Can he make amends with his own family, especially his estranged son? Over the course of 330 pages, all is revealed.<br /><br />The real appeal of the book is its portraits of Boston, the 80's, and Harry. (Get your reading glasses checked if you can't see the plot twist coming a mile away). There are some fantastic descriptions, and the spirit of that place in time is captured with complete authority. This is honest. It's the real deal.<br /><br />It's just that real life is the thing that foolish young dudes like me pick up books to escape.<br /><br />Three and a half stars outta five, and another anecdote in evidence that ex-pat eyes capture with amazing clarity their native country.	2005-10-11

The first story featured a murder mystery within the animation industry (Michael Joens has past week in the animation field.) and in this novel, the plot revolves around people involved in horse-racing and breeding.<br /><br />Our heroine, Sandra Cameron is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from the events of the past story. She's having nightmares as well as breakdowns and although her relationship with Tom Rigby, as well the kitten Sylvie he gave to her, have helped, she's still pretty messed up. Things only seem to go from bad to worse when the murder case in this novel, of horse trainer  Chet Gundry, ends up involving both her and her father as potential suspects.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, there are more deaths and more potential suspects as well. The web grows quite complicated and the strain takes its toll on both Sandra and Tom. It'll keep you guessing right up to the end.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy \\"Blood Reins\\" quite as much as \\"An Animated Death in Burbank,\\" but overall it was still a great story. It's probably just because I have an interest in animation, but don't really care much about horses. Still, if you enjoyed the first book in the series, you'll probably like this one. And I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment in the series.	2005-10-11

Volume II contains The Thousand Cities, which is told from the Marukaner General Abivard's point of view, and Videssos Besieged, which is told by his counterpart (and foe) the Videssian Emperor. Abivard has come  up in the world since the first book in the series (see Time of Troubles I for The Stolen Throne).  Now the General to King Sharbaraz, Abivard finds his problems have gotten more difficult.  While he has successfully invaded all the Westlands of Videssos, he cannot find a way to cross the sea into the capital.  Meanwhile the Videssan army is now striking back, using their navy to place troops wherever they wish.  King Sharbaraz expects Abivard to win more and more battles while offering fewer resources and troops.  And his wife Roshnani, while always offering able counsel, contines to urge big changes in Marukan society.   <br /> <br />Videssos Besieged is again told by now-Emperor Maniakes, who is losing support as the war continues to falter.  Tax revenues are almost non-existant with the Marukan army occupying most of the West, and the Kubrati invading from the North.  Now he's losing the support of the priests and the people for committing incest; he married his first cousin and he's quite happy about it.  Turtledove shows us his background as a technical writer in spending far too long describing a magical spell in forging a document that's just a fantasy version of cut and paste using an actual (squeak!) mouse. <br /> <br />Once again the books closely follow the history of the Byzantine Empire, with magic overlayed here and there. This is the same formula, history meets fantasy, used in the Darkness series (which retold World War II as a sword and sorcery epic) and the Peachtree trilogy (The US Civil War). Turtledove, as always, does it well. <br /> <br />I can't give the book (the two novels) five stars because the characters are too similar to Turtledove's other heroes: logical-thinking straight-talking types married to women much like themselves. The characters observe repeatedly that war kills people, that women do battle in the birthing bed, and that people are people the world over. The books are enjoyable but don't make the leap to profound.	2005-10-10

By the time of 1993's Meatmen Volume 14, the publisher and several of his better contributors had already parted company, and the cracks were beginning to show; the front and back covers by 'Osze' on this volume were a particular error in judgement, as while you can get away with a certain percentage of duff art inside, slapping mediocrely-traced fanboy sketches on the front of the book will only deter possible readers and browsers. <br />Inside, there's many of the usual faces; a vintage Tom of Finland, \\"Forced Entry\\" by 'Stephen', admittedly the strongest and most erotic story in the book, where opportunistic burglars take more than their victim's valuables; 'Sean's \\"Tunnel of Lust\\", with his usual cast of Jethro-clones. All good, fun stuff, and joined this time by Neal Adams-wannabe 'Hozer', and Joven's \\"Jack Masters, Private Dick\\", two creditable and nicely-drawn genre pieces.  <br />However, there's also lengthy contributions from the dated and distorted 'Mike', John Blackburn's 'Coley' who's convoluted and overly-ornate style doesn't work for me, the aforementioned 'Osze', and Farraday, one of the less competent renderers ever to hit Meatmen's pages. \\"Jackin' Off\\", by 'Joe', while faithfully traced from physique and porno mags, lacks credibility and fails to satisfy. So, that's half of the 'serious' contribs in some way deficient. <br />On the comedy front, things are more hopeful; Donelan and Kurt Erichsen work their usual bitchy magic, (what, no Jeff Krell's \\"Jayson\\" this time round? For shame!) and surprisingly, 'The Hun' proves more adept at one-off funnies this time than he ever does in his claustrophobic and sticky-fingered porno stories. <br />Not without merit, by any means, but if you're not a hopeless completist, and just want to sample a Meatmen volume, there are several rather better ones to try.	2005-10-10

It is a sturdy book that will put up with a lot of wear and use. There are nice color pictures and some recipes have pictures of how to make a dish to go with the directions.<br /><br />The recipes are fun and are from all over Asia. They are actually devided into country of origin rather than by type of recipe. For example, the recipes from one country are grouped together rather than having all of the chicken dishes grouped together. I like the layout and look of this book and have found it easy to use.<br /><br />While it has some ingredients that are uncommon that is part of the nature of cooking these types of dishes. The directions are easy to follow and the results are great. There are some of the more traditional type of dishes you might expect to find (egg rolls, spring rolls etc) and some unexpected recipes as well.<br /><br />I really enjoy this cookbook. I use it quite a bit.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-10-10

Nancy Chandler Pittman makes NO apologies for her weird doctrinal blends..Much Christianity comes from Pagan religions. I like people who are not afraid to use logic..What the H? She has interesting historical sources for the feminization of the Holy Spirit which is very interesting. She quotes rich and diverse sources. At least in this section, her scholarship is thorough unlike what some of her reviewers have said. Kings X is a group that sings metal and funk and Beatles style stuff for those of you who may be interested in Christian-Wicca rock, check out \\"Gretchen Goes to Nebraska\\" (named for Lion,Witch and Wardrobe by C.S.Lewis I think..)by them. Carl McColman (sp?) has written a book called \\"Embracing Jesus and the Goddess\\"( I think), which is well written. And it flows better than Nancy's work, and is more exciting, but the scholarly work is hard to make readable. Nancy's work is interesting when she talks about the evolution of her belief system into what is Christian Wicca, a weird mishmash. But whatever..Makes for a chock-filled rich liturgy. Hey..Give us a line on how your beliefs develop..Notice this is (Mary is sacred..)the OnLy book, I have darker leanings,(see my other reviews..), . ..with such a (..dark!..)name for these beliefs, and I reward pioneers.

He has also created a main character who is pretty despicable yet always seeking the reader's approval--kind of pathetic.  Anyway, everyone just love love loves this book, so I decided to read it and was VERY disappointed.  Hosseini is not a good writer; he perpetually tries too hard.  The more gruesome plot points are calculated to make the reader feel oh-so-outraged and superior, but paradoxically are also rather prurient.  The villain is a caricature and there is no plausible explanation for his sadism.  I want high quality writing out of a book.  In my opinion, this book failed on that score.  There is some interesting information about Afghanistan and Kabul, but that was an incidental positive in the mostly negative experience of reading the book.	2005-10-10

What he ends up with is a variety of veiled threats from police hierarchy and the feds to lay off, which of course, just pushes him further into the investigation. As Bosch continues his digging the reader begins to perceive that what seems to be a promising storyline ends up being fairly predictable tale of greed and revenge with innocents caught in the middle. For a number of other writers this would have been good work but for Connelly it comes off as more than a little disappointing. It was nowhere near as emotionally involving as the other Bosch novels I've read; it comes off a bit perfunctory. There is a major surprise in Bosch's personal life revealed within, but even that comes off as anti-climactic. It's three stars because even bad Connelly is better than most, it is always readable and entertaining but it isn't up to par. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Ninety-seven handy suggestions to improve the quality of your best friend's life with fun and games and the occasional good-spirited prank.<br /><br />My mom has this book and her kind-natured, if slightly dim three-year-old Chessie-Collie mix, Fergus, loves some of the suggestions in here. One of the ones I've tried with him is number eighty-two: slingshooting treats for him to catch using a plastic spoon as a catapult. Another one that seems particularly enjoyed is number eighteen: juggling. I've always been a good juggler and when I juggle things Fergus wants, like a trio of rolled-up socks or tennis balls, he goes NUTZ trying to leap up and get what I'm keeping right out of his reach. It's a hoot.<br /><br />The one suggestion that really tripped me out, though, and had me laughing was number thirty-two: \\"The Three Little Bears routine\\" which involves sneaking into your pet's bed and letting him catch you there for a change. Ha!!! Haven't tried that one yet but maybe I will when the time is right. Justice for all the times he's sneaked up onto Mom's furniture and stuff.<br /><br />This cheerful little book is great not only for the ideas it gives you but for its ninety-seven pages of smiling, happy doggies!	2005-10-10

(I guess my loss of interest says more about me than the subject matter.)  I took just under 6 months to read this book, ponder its meaning, and research scriptural and other sources to see if it is correct in its teachings.  And after spending a lifetime as a follower and admirer of the carpenter from Nazareth who is the Son of God, I can only say that this book did more for my understanding of the doctrine of the Atonement than any other book short of scripture.<br /><br />The writing is clear and concise.  The author has obviously distilled the study of a lifetime into this volume because it carries quotes from so many disparate sources that would have taken years to accumulate.  From his background as a lawyer, the author is uniquely qualified to discuss justice, mercy and other related concepts.  His main sources are scriptures - that is the Bible and also scriptures unique to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon).  C.S. Lewis and Joseph Smith are also two common sources.<br /><br />The 300 pages of this book contain chapters on why an atonement is needed, what is the nature of the atonement, what it means, and how it was accomplished.  The atonement is the central doctrine of Christianity and is so comprehensive and overwhelming in its scope that a guide such as this one is extrememly useful.<br /><br />And besides the high intellectual content of this work, I found myself pondering over and over again the particularized question, \\"Considering what a failure I am, how is it possible that a Savior could care enough for me to suffer and die for me?\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to anyone.	2005-10-10

Before I write my review I will just give a disclaimer, which is that I enjoyed this book and you probably will too.  It was entertaining.  You will particularly enjoy it if you don't know anything about Marie Antoinette.  I already knew all this stuff and still thought it was fun.  If it's all new to you, you will like the dishy and accurate details of, e.g., the King's inability to consummate the royal marriage for seven whole years.  Great stuff, very dishy, and the author knows how to write a page turner.  So, on that level I say go buy it.  It gave me some hours of fun.  Although, you might find it downright insane that the Diamond Necklace Affair, one of the most infamous court scandals of the 1780s and the one believed to have played a major role in fatally defaming Marie Antoinette, was not mentioned at all!  Not once!  It was important enough to be a recent movie with 2 time oscar winner Hillary Swank, but this author decided not to include a single mention of it.    So, on another, more deeper level, I'm actually a historian so I have to say that this kind of friviolous, uninformative and selective-omission type writing irritates me to a degree. We already know so much about this woman, and while I do not believe she deserved her fate (I'm against the death penalty period!) I think she is a poor subject for literature.  It's interesting that such an ordinary man (Louis the Last) and woman (Widow Capet) with such uninspiring personalities would end up being thrown into such a situation by an accident of fate, but that only goes so far.      After awhile, when you realize there is real history of import out there, you have to wonder why there are thousands upon thousands of books about Marie Antoinette.  It's very elitist.  Let's face it,it's like Princess Diana being on the cover of all those magazines.  Yes, she seemed like a nice lady and yes, it's sad that she ended up in awful situations.  But what about people like Nelson Mandela?  They're a lot more interesting and tell us a lot more about the heroic potential of the human spirit than some woman who, at the end of the day, really was frivolous.  She may not have said \\"Qu'ils mangent du gateau\\" (let them eat cake), but she did spend much money on finery while people starved to death.  A modern-day dictator would hardly be celebrated in fluff literature for such choices.  And if they would, we have to question our values system.      Which brings me to my absolute least favorite part of the book.  It was relatively accurate despite some of the fictious characters-until the end.  It really bothered me that the author takes a Dickensian approach toward revolutionary violence...well, she takes the approach of of all conservative writers from the time of the revolution to now (i.e., Simon Schama).  I don't defend violence, but she made no attempt to understand or portray what drives the desperately poor and needy to acts of intense inhumanity then, and this still happens now.      I understand the author is trying to \\"be\\" Marie Antoinette, so her \\"insights\\" are limited, but I think it's a little ridiculous and contrived to make up a stupid personality for Robespierre and an even dumber meeting between him and the Queen.  The author's Robespierre is based almost entirely on Mme. Roland's memoirs, the famous and bizarre aside Mme Roland made about the Incorruptible having greenish veins which was later turned by Carlyle into the infamous \\"sea-green Incorruptible\\". Madame Roland was about the only source ever claiming Robespierre was \\"green\\".  Most people said he was quite pleasant looking.  I ought to know.  I've read about seventeen biographies on the man.  (Don't ask).    She exaggerated everything about him and completely obscured his actual personality. He was misguided, but not in the way she portrayed it.       It was a total recycled, post-Thermidorian cartoon of the man, which is not good history, it's not even decent historical fiction.  He wasn't out of control in the way she wrote it.  Also, he stands in for every other revolutionary.  Only Marat and Mirabeau are mentioned, and barely at that.      Keep in mind that it's awful history and think of it more as \\"Jackie Collins in 18th Century France\\".  Which is fine, but I still think they could've made it a little less ridiculous.  I don't like real historical figures to be simplified down to cartoon characters.  The cartoon gets remembered and nothing else-which is the dumbest form of history out there.	2005-10-10

It doesn't feel dated however.   <br /> <br />This book offers examples.  Before needle exchanges took place in the US, they were shown to work in Australia and other countries.  One author said drug users need to organize like the gay male community has.  At first, this sounded naive, but the author stated that it has happened in the Netherlands.  This book mentions solutions that work:  using bleach on syringes, having drug addicts teach each other about avoiding STDs, etc.  This book implies that drug addicts have learned to clean their needles, but that hasn't helped them to have safer sex.  I wish I could have learned more about cocaine generally:  how to spot a user, how to know if someone has re-started, how to encourage them to quit drug use because they may contract the virus. <br /> <br />I won't call this book homophobic, but it's a bit heterosexist.  Several authors state that, \\"cocaine users could spread HIV to their children and wives.\\"  There is little discussion of the many MSM who also use drugs.  What about the fact that they may be spreading the virus to non-drug-using male lovers?  The book never mentions that some straight-identified drug users engage in same-sex prostitution to score drugs.  Thus, though they do not identify as \\"gay,\\" they may get the virus through same-sex sexual activities.	2005-10-10

An icky, but essentially boring fact of life (like sewage, which also comes into the discussion). True, it is a guilt-inducing environmental hazard we ordinary mortals can't do much about, but there are all sorts of people out there for whom your detritus is a livelihood, a challenge, a crusade or all three.<br /><br />And Elizabeth Royte's lively, anecdotal adventure on the trail of trash introduces us to many of them, from the two sanitary workers who personally shift 20,000 pounds in the four hours she accompanies them, to the head of San Francisco's recycling program who manages to divert 95 percent of his household trash from the landfill in headlong pursuit of Zero Waste.<br /><br />Royte frames the story around her own household trash in Brooklyn, NY. For a year she weighs and sorts it, taking notes on its contents. She wants to know where it goes when it leaves her. Her first foray with a \\"san man\\" (New York has one female garbage collector) team is an eye opener.<br /><br />\\"The men seemed dour and angry to me and I was afraid to ask them questions. On foot, I watched and I followed. Soon I realized they seemed sour only because they were concentrating. In constant motion, lifting heavy barrels, they could get hurt if they didn't pay attention. Metal cans banged against their legs; trailer hitches poked from high SUV bumpers. Drivers honked, urging the men to hustle it up, to get their truck out of their way. Double-parked delivery vans blocked their progress. There was also a surprising amount of dog [dirt] near the garbage cans and many plastic bags were shiny with urine. Had I never noticed this before?\\"<br /><br />Garbage collection, it turns out, is three times more likely to get you killed than being a fireman or a policeman.<br /><br />A couple of transfer stations later (from which most of NYC's garbage heads to other states) Royte is ready for a real landfill. Although now closed, \\"the Fresh Kills Sanitary Landfill was the K2 of trash heaps, and I was determined to make an assault on its closed and forbidden slopes.\\" Unable to get in, she explores the evolution of landfills in grisly detail, makes a canoe foray around the place through a successful salt marsh restoration, describes state-of-the-art dump technology and its various oozing, leaching failures, and then fails to get into a lesser Pennsylvania dump -the final resting place of her own actual trash.<br /><br />People who handle large amounts of our trash, Royte discovers again and again, are more than a little secretive. \\" `This isn't goods they're transferring from place to place,' \\" she's told, \\" `This is bads.' \\"<br /><br />Amusing and adroit as Royte is, landfill descriptions lose their savor after an unsurprisingly short time, but she moves on to incinerators, waste-to-energy incinerators, sewage and sludge fertilizer and myriad forms of recycling. Not a one of them is a winner in the fight against expense, pollution and energy consumption.<br /><br />Waste to energy plants seem like a dream come true. Burn garbage and furnish energy. But the plants are very expensive and the toxins they produce - both airborne and ash - contain things like dioxins, mercury, lead and sulphuric acid, to name a few.<br /><br />Recycling efforts teem with politics, psychology and futility. Some environmentalists are avid recyclers; others object to recycling as a panacea that soothes the guilt of the average householder, making us feel like we're doing our bit, and takes the heat off manufacturers who should be held ultimately responsible for the things (especially the packaging) they produce. Yes, recycling can save trees, but recycling uses energy and produces toxins. Plastic recycling is particularly problematic.<br /><br />And, to put things in perspective, 98 percent of all trash is pre-consumer. Industrial. But Royte, who would clearly like to reduce her own garbage \\"footprint,\\" weighs it all, keeps her sense of humor, and arrives at a balance.

And that is surely a story that is worth knowing and remembering, as are the landings at Utah, Gold, Juno, and Sword.  The problem is that the landing becomes the shorthand for the entire campaign in France, as if once the troops were off the beaches the fierce fighting was over and all that was left was the dash to Berlin.  In reality, Hitler threw everything he could at these forces with the intent of pushing them back into the sea.  He understood that once a breakout occurred, it would be all but impossible to stop their advance towards Berlin.  Montgomery expected the Nazi forces to pull back across the Seine and reform their defenses there.  Instead, Hitler threw most of the available Nazi forces at the British and Canadian positions in what became a fierce stalemate.  Eisenhower, putting perspective on this fighting in the Caen sector said, \\"ten feet gained on the Caen sector was equivalent to a mile elsewhere.\\" (Pg 311)<br /><br />There is debate whether Montgomery intended his troops to be in an awful and bloody stalemate while only telling his forces they were there to break through the Nazi line, or whether he really hoped for a breakout that never materialized.  In either case, the fierce fighting by these British and Canadian forces absorbed so much of the Nazi effort that it allowed Patton and his fabulous 3rd Army to break out and perform his breakthrough further down the line of the fighting like a running back going around the crush of the lines to an open field.<br /><br />The author of this amazing book, George G. Blackburn, was there as a young artillery officer during this fighting as part of an artillery regiment that moved, set-up, and fired 25 pounder cannon to support the ground forces.  Do not think for a moment that this was not harrowing and exhausting duty.  The enemy desperately wanted these guns disabled and was relentless in trying to destroy these men and their equipment.  As on officer, he also describes in vivid detail his first turn as a FOO (Forward Observation Officer).  These are the brave men who go to the front and direct the fire of the canon onto the targets.  The casualty rate for this duty is almost total and the bravery of some of these officers in standing out in the open directing tank fire onto targets is beyond understanding.<br /><br />While it is certainly true that those of us who have never been in combat can never know what it is like, particularly in the kind of ferocious fighting and massed conflict documented in this book, but that argument is also a truism.  Books are written to convey knowledge to another and are valuable because they allow us to know things other than those we directly experience.  This book is so forcefully written with descriptions that are so immediate and fearsome, that it will likely affect your dreams.  I know it did mine.<br /><br />Also, movies are a powerful medium, but I know of none that can convey the random death, extreme violence, comprehensive exhaustion, stench, and feculence as vividly as this book.  Blackburn allows us to understand the exhaustion of moving tons of earth, rock, and mud to create the pits for the guns, moving more tons of ammunition getting it into pits, the duty of firing the guns around the clock, and then finding your own slit trench (foxhole) to keep yourself alive during those brief moments of rest all the while hoping one of the incoming shells isn't headed for you.<br />When the high speed shells from the Nazi 88s bang into camp and lives are spared because of Czech's built duds to hurt the Nazi effort, we feel the strange exhilaration at being so randomly intact, and yet there is constant fear that the next round coming in might be live and make you dead.  The randomness of trying to take shelter and having fragments destroy something right next to you and yet you are spared is constantly disorienting, yet you stay on your tasks.  Blackburn describes how once he found one tiny fragment of shrapnel in his backpack when he went for a pair of his socks and found only cut up ball of thread, such was the spin velocity and razor edge of the fragment.<br /><br />Then there is the demoralization of moving into an area where you have to dig pits for the guns and yourselves and find chalk just below the surface.  Hours of work with a pickaxe remove only a foot of rock.  Yet the need to protect the guns, the ammo, and yourselves keeps everyone hacking down into chalk.  There were also the two bombings behind the front by Allied Forces costing hundreds of lives and much needed equipment.  First it was the US and then, a couple of weeks later, the RAF.  It was a combination of errors in navigation and, in the second case, a misunderstanding of the signal to use to mark the front of the line.<br /><br />Yet, there is tremendous comradeship.  Blackburn describes how it works more effectively than I have ever heard.  Because of all the casualties, there is a constant stream of replacement soldiers and officers.  Yet, men will risk their lives to care for men they do not know.  They will huddle ever more closely in an impossibly crowded trench to give a new guy at the entrance a few more inches to get him out of the rain and a bit more shelter from enemy fire.<br /><br />The events covered in this book are the few weeks between July 1 and September 5, 1944.  This is a short time in civilian life, but through this book you will experience events that make this seem like an eternity.  The horror of all the rotting flesh, human and farm animals, the dysentery, the artillery that is fired so frequently it glows red in the night, and the inhuman noise will almost wear you out as your read the book.<br /><br />Mr. Blackburn recounts not only his own experiences (in the second person), but provides other stories and background through interviews with other people and official documents and reliable histories.  It is a terrific book because it provides us insight into a part of the Second World War our shorthand way of remembering past events does not provide.  For Americans, it is also wonderful to read about the sacrifices our neighbors to the North made to help our forces break out towards Berlin.  And I found the efforts of the artillerymen, supposedly back of the fighting, positively heroic.  Do yourself a favor and experience this book.  You will feel gratitude towards a generation that is leaving us all too rapidly and understand more what our armed forces are today providing for us all over the world.bes how once he found one tiny fragment of shrapnel in his backpack when he went for a pair of his socks and found only cut up ball of thread, such was the spin velocity and razor edge of the fragment.

In 2004, Richardson, a highly regarded specialist in royal and peerage genealogy with numerous published articles to his credit, brought out the first volume in a planned series -- _Plantagenet Ancestry,_ which tracked the descents of some 190 immigrants to the North American colonies from the Plantagenet monarchs of England, and which weighed in at 945 pages. This second installment is 150 pages thicker, and there are at least two more volumes in development, on descents from early feudal barons, and from the Emperor Charlemagne.<br /><br />Any high school graduate knows the term \\"Magna Carta\\" (the \\"Great Charter\\") but most have probably only a hazy understanding of its key role as the foundation of the English legislative system (and therefore of our own), and that it established the principle that even the king, the highest authority in the land, was subject to the law. The baronial party that forced King John to sign the document in 1215 didn't trust him to live up to the limitations and conditions it laid down, and so they elected from among their own number twenty-five barons to monitor and enforce compliance. Of these twenty-five Sureties, seventeen had descendants past four generations; of those, there were two father-son pairs (Richard and Gilbert de Clare, earls of Hertford, and Roger and Hugh Bigod, earls of Norfolk), leaving fifteen distinct families that were ancestral to 238 17th century North American colonists. As with the first volume, the author's careful organization of a large mass of complex data makes this a comparatively easy book to use, either for ready-reference or for extended reading. All descendant families are organized alphabetically, numbered generationally from the Magna Carta Surety, with emphasis on patrilineal descents. This is not a listing of all descendants in each generation; grandchildren without descendants themselves, for instance, are excluded. Citation of sources -- mostly the original sources -- is very extensive and the bibliography runs to nearly 100 large-size pages.<br /><br />With such a wide-ranging project, with so many sources being perused, one might hope for new discoveries, and there are many included in the book. Some, of course are minor corrections, but at least a dozen are noteworthy, especially as they affect the Bohun, de Verdun, Grey, Hastings, Pole, FitzMaurice, and Mowbray families.<br /><br />As with _Plantagenet Ancestry,_ after borrowing it for review, I bought a copy of this one for myself and I shall be waiting eagerly for subsequent volumes in the series.bibliography runs to nearly 100 large-size pages.<br /><br />With such a wide-ranging project, with so many sources being perused, one might hope for new discoveries, and there are many included in the book.

As I read the book,  I was mesmerized by the words of Ashley Smith and Stacy Mattingly (her co-author).  When the story first broke last March, I told my local book store owner that the book would be appearing and when it did to let me know. She did ; I bought it and read it in one evening. I was so inspired by Ashley's  story. Much of the writing, I am sure was done by Stacy Mattingly, who has assisted others in Christian writing...but the thoughts and feeling are those of Ashley Smith. Because of Ashley Smith, I have gone back to read and re-read  The Purpose-Driven Life by Rick Warren. Two people gave The Purpose-Driven Life to me when it first came out...i guess they saw in me a need for Rick Warren's message...they were correct.  I have had a problem strewn life..all kinds of problems since early childhood...I think I understand Ashlely. Her life is similar to many of the students with whom I work every day...coming from a \\"good home\\" means nothing...nor does coming from a \\"bad home\\" either..not in and of itself...it is all about the inside of you and what is in your heart. Ashley still has demons to deal with..so do all of us.  I probably will never write my book..mainly because I do not have the courage to tell my story for all the world to see.  It does take much courage to put yourself out there. Thank God she did survive to tell her story...I, for one, am richer in my spirit because of Ashely and her book.	2005-10-10

I am a mother of a sensory child.  This book changed my life, and it is an essential resource for anyone who wants to learn or help a child with sensory integration.  It is my \\"Bible\\".<br /><br />Unlike most books on sensory integration, it was written by a mother Nancy Peske, and an OT, Lindsey Biel, who understand what it is like to have and raise and treat a sensory child.  It is easy to read and understand and begins by telling a story of Nancy Peske's own personal experiences with her own child to explain what it is like to have a sensory child, and to accept that you have a sensory child and how to help your sensory child.<br /><br />This wonderful book provides practical solutions for everyday living.  This book truly helps you to understand what sensory issues are, and what the technical language means (in easy to understand explanations and examples).<br /><br />This book is the best I have ever read with respect to providing specific techniques you can use to help your sensory child to eat, play, sleep and learn efficiently, to focus, to pay attention, to organize, to self-regulate and so much more.<br /><br />This book also tells you what you can do as a parent to help advocate for your child.  It provides the steps for evaluation, and the types of therapies which are available at home and what to expect when you work with an OT. The book also contains information on how to set up an IEP or a 504 plan for your child and how to get the services you need to help your child.<br /><br />This book is extremely practical and what I like the best about it, is that is written like a handbook, so that if you already are familiar with sensory integration, you can read any chapter without having to read the entire book to find the resources that you need.  The book provides plenty of links to current research and valuable sources of information in books, videos, DVDs and online, which have made such a huge difference in my life and my son's life!<br /><br />I have read all the books and research on the internet out there on sensory integration and this book is definitely the best.  I recommend it to any parent, teacher, caregiver, OT or friend who wants to help understand and/or successfully treat a child with sensory integration.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you also read the Out of Sync Child, and the Out of Sync Child Has Fun, by Carol Stock Kranowitz which are also essential resources on sensory integration.ead all the books and research on the internet out there on sensory integration and this book is definitely the best.

There's an unsolved mystery deep in the ancestral past of Geneva Settle.  It has been 140 years since freed slave Charles Singleton was on the run from authorities, accused of murder and of dabbling in the dangerous social politics of the time.  Is it for this reason, forensic consultant Lincoln Rhymes asks his team, that sixteen year old Geneva was attacked as she researched this puzzle?  Or was it for inadvertently witnessing something that she shouldn't?  Someone out there is determined to get to Geneva, and fast.  Lincoln offers the protection of his home when it becomes apparent that Geneva cannot be left on the outside, even with police protection.    Whoever has put the orders out from above to take Geneva doesn't mind having a little police collateral damage along the way. <br />  <br />Working the scenes via his able bodied partner, policewoman Amelia Sachs, Rhyme is in two minds whether to expend manpower on solving a very old mystery or to concentrate on letting his brilliant mind work its magic on the actions of a killer in the present.  Charles Singleton gave tantalizing clues as to a the discovery of a great injustice to the American people in letters to his family, and it is from examining these that Rhyme is sure that the past is connected to these crimes of the present.  As the team of police and Rhyme sift through the mine of forensic evidence left at the crime scenes of the day they draw closer to finding out why someone would consider a Harlem schoolgirl such a threat that she warrants an immediate execution. <br />  <br />As with all the entries in this series, Rhyme's crew take a scientific approach on the environment and particulars of a crime scene in order to give the police a clearer path to a murderer.  The summary given at the end of each chapter helps the reader to assess and make their own conclusions in a sense of real-time along with the characters.  While the strength of these novels has always been in the details, there is not enough action and intrigue in \\"The Twelfth Card\\" to balance and back up the forensic detailing.  Another failing of this novel is the street language used by the various petty criminals and the school girls themselves.  At best it comes across as dated, at worst, laughable.  While still a tightly plotted crime novel, this read lacks any real pull or sense of suspense and isn't the best representation of an excellent series that has no apparent peer. <br />	2005-10-10

This is a good guide to brain-tech, and really the only one that serves it's purpose.  It is, as other reviewers have mentioned, quite dated, and there are many products out on the market now which just aren't in this book.  Obviously, however, an intelligent consumer can supplement their reading of this book with research on the web to find out about the products that are out now.  I discovered the floatation tank, CES, integrated motion systems, smart drugs, sound tables and many other useful tools through this book.  I got started in all this stuff by buying a light and sound machine from a magazine advertisement, 15 years ago, and until reading Megabrain I didn't know about the other stuff.  CES has greatly enhanced my life, and soon I'm going to buy a floatation tank now that I can afford it.  Simply put, there is no other book that concentrates all of these and other items into one single book.  That is why this is the only book that is going to make people aware that so many of these things exist.  For example:  I know plenty of people who are aware of the floatation tank, but not aware of CES.  I also know people who are aware of light and sound machines, but not aware of floatation.  This is why, no matter how dated the book is, it's going to remain a classic for those who might potentially become true connoissieurs of brain-tech, and indispensible to the explorer who is just beginning.  The writing style is admittedly, very periodical-like, however I don't see a problem with this since it is basically a consumer guide.  The book shouldn't really attempt to tell you every little thing you can do with each and every gadget, it can only give you a bit of the theory behind each product, and give you a general idea of what it does.  I do think, however, that the author should consider coming out with a new edition or perhaps start from scratch with an entirely new book that fulfills the same purpose.	2005-10-10

This is a highly riveting account of the only FBI agent in history, Joe Pistone, ever to be proposed for membership in the mob. For six years Pistone worked and lived with made guys - hardcore mobsters who do not tolerate mistakes, idiots or rats (informers). This hard-hitting, real-world account takes you deep inside the thoughts, lives and actions of these individuals.  Some have reported that the language and descriptions within this book are too much.  This ain't Disneyland, ya know.  Pistone's writing style places you in the middle of the fire from the very first page and holds you there until the end. For his end, Pistone possesses nads of solid boron, one of the hardest metals known to mankind.  Second by second, for six long years, Pistone was in effect a mobster.  He stayed alive by his magnificent acting ability, fortitude and unadulterated guts.  In spite of the hardships for himself and his family, who he rarely saw during this time, he stuck it out to the very end when the FBI had to end the operation because Pistone was scheduled to make a hit.  The mob was caught off guard and there was indeed hell to pay.  My only complaint about this book is that it was not long enough.  I could have read on for days.	2005-10-10

It's all here: history, cultural references, highlights of different regions, and maps and old photographs that let you connect with the country-and your heritage. <br /> <br />Do not miss this book if you are planning a trip to Sweden. This book will definitely help sketch out for you what your trip should be about. Then you can go ahead and buy a travel book for the details of surviving and getting around. <br /> <br />But the main focus of the book is tracing your Swedish ancestry through the different available sources. All the other stuff works to support you in your research. There are examples of how to find and use the church records, locations that now have them available on microfiche, other possible sources of information, and up-to-date web references. And it's all presented in a useful, readable, and quotable style. You may even find yourself talking out loud in Swedish as you read what the different church records may have recorded to keep track of the people. I have gone through this book twice on my own, and even now, I still read parts out loud to impress my friends with my Swedish heritage.	2005-10-10

She was a precocious seven when her parents announced they were moving from Los Angeles to backwater Ahmednagar.<br /><br />It was there that the guru they had been devoted to since their drugged-out Berkeley college days, Meher Baba (who Brown credits with the saying, \\"Don't worry, be happy), had established an ashram. \\"Its residents usually explained where it was by saying, `Get on a train in Bombay, and go east for nine hours.' \\"<br /><br />From the start, Brown was appalled. \\"I didn't care about Baba....But I knew there was nothing I could do. There was already an envelope in Dad's dresser drawer containing three one-way tickets to India.\\" Over the next five years a deep component of sheer misery would be added to that feeling of shock and helplessness.<br /><br />She opens the book with an account of one of their rare vacations. The ashram \\"was located in what I had previously thought of as the most desolate place in India. But the expanse of brown-baked weeds about a hundred miles west of Ahmednagar was giving it some serious competition.\\"<br /><br />Stranded, Brown reads a fantasy novel while her parents squabble about whose fault it is there is no train to their mountain hotel.<br /><br />\\"The novel's heroine, Harry, was a foreign girl who gets kidnapped by desert nomads and learns to ride bareback and do magic.<br /><br />\\"Certainly I could identify with the `kidnapped and taken to a foreign desert' part, though I wished I were enjoying my experience as much as Harry was enjoying hers. I also wished three of her magnificent desert steeds would appear, so we could ride them up the mountain.<br /><br />\\"Mom poked me. `Don't just sit there with your nose in a book. Pray with me.'<br /><br />\\"On second thought, perhaps only one steed.\\"<br /><br />This pretty much sums up the family dynamic. Brown spent as much time as possible buried in a book, while her mother's response to everything was to chant, \\"Baba, Baba, Baba,\\" and her father kept clear of the fray as much as possible.<br /><br />Even the escape into books was made difficult. The ashram librarian was an unkempt, irascible Indian who took immediate exception to the compound's only child snooping around his tiny, dusty domain and began screaming at her to \\"Get out!\\" before they were even introduced.<br /><br />School was even worse. A Catholic school where Brown was the only foreigner, it had  English textbooks but classes were taught in Hindi. Brown, who had been an exceptional student, was soon failing. She might have overcome the language barrier if not for the sadism of her teacher, a type (not rare enough) whose professional zeal seems focused on the opportunity to bully those who can't fight back.<br /><br />On her first day Brown took comfort in the thought that \\"Manija,\\" the hated name that set her apart in America, would not be a problem in India and neither would its diminutive, \\"Mani,\\" which rhymes with money. But after Mrs. Joshi introduced her to the class, she had the students open their books to a comic rhyme that poked fun at \\"Mani Mao,\\" baby talk for \\"Mrs. Cat.\\" Brown was thereafter known as Mani Mao and pelted with stones in the schoolyard and whenever spotted alone on the streets of the town.<br /><br />As for her name, Brown changed it to Rachel the minute she graduated high school back in America and now delivers a word of warning: \\"Parents, if you do not want your children to write tell-all memoirs when they grow up, do not name them KhrYstYll, Pebble, or Shaka Zulu.\\"<br /><br />The ashram itself seems primarily populated by misfits and the mentally ill, whose ranks are routinely swelled with pilgrims from America. In all her years there Brown made only one friend, a boy who stayed for some months and whose father was one of the deranged visitors. Her accounts of their role-playing adventuresare the only carefree, unfettered moments in the book. The adult she most admired was, in the end, responsible for the most harrowing, disillusioning and cruel incident in her childhood.<br /><br />Although the life she describes is miserable, Brown herself never appears pitiable. Although resigned, she remains full of spunk and spirit, saved by her imagination. She never connected to Baba or spiritual life in general and comes across as practical, independent, driven and engaging. These qualities, along with her writing skill, came in handy at age 12 when her father left India and didn't take her with him. It took her six months of daily letters to persuade him.<br /><br />Brown interrupts her narrative several times, giving the reader views of her adult life (she's now an award-winning playwright and TV writer) and relations with her parents. She includes an account of her decision to confront the ashram years by writing about them, and her parents' reactions and input. This leads to a last page that is so perfectly apt it could have been fiction - but you'll know it's not.<br /><br />Funny, brave and sharp, Brown gives us a heroine and a writer to root for.<br /><br />--Portsmouth Heraldheir role-playing adventures are the only carefree, unfettered moments in the book.

Not because of his pioneer works in electronics, which were one of the foundations for the rise of the Silicon Valley companies and their technological progress and commercial success, but because of his views about the danger of declining cognitive capabilities in the United States. Convinced of the mainly hereditary origin of intelligence differences, Shockley saw a clear dysgenic trend in Western societies and publicly talked and wrote about the causes and possible remedies of this development. The most important of his articles about these topics can be found in \\"Shockley on Eugenics and Race\\". These essays demonstrate that Shockley wasn't motivated by racial oder elitist prejudices, but by certain facts and serious concern about the future of Western civilization. Shockley's articles with such provoking titles as \\"Society has a Moral Obligation to Diagnose Tragic Racial IQ Deficits\\" or \\" Has Intellectual Humanitarianism Gone Berserk?\\" are no scientific papers about cognitive psychology, behavioral genetics or the social implications of eugenics, but nevertheless interesting statements of a highly intelligent outsider in these fields, in a debate which isn't finished. The most interesting parts of the book are a lengthy \\"Preface\\" of the eminent psychologist Arthur R. Jensen, who thinks of W. B. Shockley as \\"a truly genius\\" (which doesn't mean that Jensen's \\"Preface\\" is an uncritical eulogy), the very informative \\"Introduction\\" of the editor Roger Pearson with many biographical details about Shockley and the political-ideological background of his activities, and finally, last but not least, the \\"Playboy\\"-Interview with Professor Shockley in August 1980. In that interview Shockley tells the reader for example - among other details of his biography (one of the most controversial themes: Shockley's famous participation in an elite sperm bank), his political and ideological opinions - that he himself was not tested as an extreme bright kid in the seminal longitudinal study of Stanford psychologist Lewis M. Terman -  the young Shockley did not belong to the Top One Percent of Californian school-children. This really strange result should be one of many reasons to remain cautious in matters of IQ and society, more cautious than the courageous electronic engineer and physicist Shockley was.elite sperm bank), his political and ideological opinions - that he himself was not tested as an extreme bright kid in the seminal longitudinal study of Stanford psychologist Lewis M.

Our last-name devoided protagonist David stupidly makes a date for a girl named Angela on the same day and time as his grandmother's birthday. Then, instead of calling Angela to reschedule (something that I'm sure she would have gone along with), he came up with the brilliant plan of making a clone of himself using a device that he found on the beach.<br /><br />The character motivations weren't very clear. If this boy is in high school, then why is he still so stupid? He deserved every single bad thing that happened to him in this book, plus some that didn't. I usually enjoy William Sleator's protagonists such as Marco from Marco's Millions and the one from Interstellar Pig whose name escapes at the moment. This one had a disturbing combination of stupidity, selfishness, and thoughtlessness that made me cheer when a cement block almost took him out.<br /><br />Anyway, after creating the duplicate, he became offended when he realized that the duplicate wasn't a servile, creeping little thing. Apparently, he expected it to skulk around saying things like, \\"yes masther and no masther\\". The duplicate acted exactly like him, and for that, David acted extremely touchy and depressed.<br /><br />David also went out of his way to shoot down every suggestion the Duplicate (let's call him 'A') said. For some reason, he wants A to stay out of sight yet doesn't want him to hide. He then jumps on every possible opportunity to blame A for attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, rape, the extinction of the dodo, and global warming (okay, I made the last two up, but it seriously gets annoying to read through it since the narrative doesn't seem to realize how unlikeable this makes David seem).<br /><br />David and his duplicate make increasingly irrational decisions based on little or no thought. I emphasize again how weak their motivations were. Their blundering stupidity leads to a less-than-joyous ending (that I felt they deserved), and it left me with a cold feeling inside.<br /><br />I won't deny that I felt robbed by this book. I felt as if each and every dime I spent on this book had been ripped from my beating heart. I know Mr. Sleator can do better than this terribly generic title. His Interstellar Pig was classic. Compared to that, The Duplicate was just...forgettable.	2005-10-10

Younger Readers (Awards))	Books	5	23	23	N	N	Tiger tiger burning bright, in the forest of the night	Before reading, \\"Tiger On a Tree\\", I hadn't really considered the American lack of children's books from India.  I mean, if you stopped the average bloke on the street and asked him to name a British children's book, you'd probably get some kind of an answer.  Probably Harry Potter.  If you asked for an Australian children's book you'd have more difficulties but at least 1 out of 100 people might know of one.  But ask someone to name an Indian children's book and all you're gonna get is blank stares.  Unless you ask someone Indian, of course.  Then you might learn something.  And what you might learn is just how great Anushka Ravishankar's, \\"Tiger On a Tree\\" is.  With very simple words, a story that's interesting while still remaining pretty darn basic, and some wildly original illustrations, \\"Tiger On a Tree\\" is bound to garner itself some enthusastic preschool fans.  Especially if they've a yen for tigers.<br /><br />In this tale, an almost perpetually amused large cat is on a kind of journey.  It goes down to a shore, crosses a river, scares an animal, and climbs a tall tree.  One of the local fisherman sees the tiger perched and shouts the alarm.  Soon all the men in the village have gathered to discuss the treed feline.  They set up a net around the perimeter of the tree and the tiger (no longer looking amused at its own adventures) is scared out of the branches by a cacophony of loud instruments, and straight into the trap.  Catching a tiger is one thing.  Figuring out what to do with him next is another entirely.  The men come up with some interesting ideas (one of the most interesting being to, \\"Paint him an electric blue\\").  Finally, however, they figure the best thing is to let him go.  The final picture shows the now once again elated kitty bounding on the opposite shore, away from the river's banks.<br /><br />The other day, I had someone ask (I'm a children's librarian) if I could recommend some rhyming picture books that were similar to the kinds of simple words used by Dr. Seuss.  Now, no one beats the Seuss.  He sort of invented the whole idea of simple words making fun books.  And while I was able to find plenty of simple books, few rhymed all the way through.  Should I ever receive this request again, I'm going to pluck \\"Tiger On a Tree\\" from my shelves immediately.  The words in this book never get much longer than \\"rubbish\\" and are perfect for children just beginning to read.  Words are presented in a black easy-to-distinguish font, large on each page (making them ideal for children with sight impediments as well).  The illustrations are an entirely different matter altogether.  Unfortunately, the publication page doesn't say how illustrator Pulak Biswas created the book's images.  In some ways, they resemble woodcuts.  In other ways, they look like broad black brushstrokes.  The only color in the book is an occasional shock of orange.  Whether the orange of the net to catch the tiger, the orange of the tiger's stripes, or the orange of the sun above, Biswas's palette is used sparingly and well.<br /><br />If I had my way, library's bookshelves would be filled with picture books from as many countries as possible.

There are so many dynamics going on in the show (such as short term goals, i.e. winning the assignment; relating to team members; and of course dealing with The Donald, and his side kicks George and Carolyn), that makes it compelling viewing all around. Don't underestimate the Donald's factor. For proof, check the oh-so-lame new Martha Stewart Apprentice show.... boring!!!<br /><br />\\"Lessons from the Apprentice: Secrets to Success from the Boardroom to the Business World\\" (176 pages) is a high-end, glossy page book that takes you back to the first 3 seasons of \\"The Apprentice\\". While the book is structured to offer \\"lessons\\", it really is a fun look back of what worked and what went horribly wrong in the teams various assignments. With 20-20 vision, many of the mistakes that the losing teams made were so obvious (Ivana dropping her pants to \\"sell\\" chocolate bars? Danny's \\"Triple Play\\" act to get people into Burger King? etc.). There are plenty of pictures and quotes from the Donald, George and Carolyn, but also from the various business executives whose company products were on the line, and in that sense, yes, the book offers lessons.<br /><br />In the end, though, this is an irreverent look back at the first three seasons of \\"The Apprentice\\", and a good one at that. In a way, it reminds me of the 3 (so far) Simpsons books that \\"dissect\\" the episodes. If you are a fan of \\"The Apprentice\\", you will love this book!	2005-10-09

Tales of cannibalism and other kinds of deprivation make the rest of us grateful to be living in the modern era.  Lewis Keseberg has Sioux burial robes.  He is told by George Donner to give them back.  It is feared the Indians will demand retribution.  Keseberg has imperiled the safety of everyone.   <br /> <br />Jim Reed does not remember Ireland at all, but he remembers crossing the Atlantic.  Jim and his wife read about California and it sounded too good to be true.  Game is scarcer the higher the party climbs.  Tempers are tested.  Reed kills Snyder and suffers banishment from the group.  Reed is given a young man as a companion to cross the desert.   <br /> <br />Fort Laramie is a sort of outpost of civilization.  Where Laramie Creek spills into the Platte it looks like a park.  Half way across the Rockies the Donner Party takes the southern route.  Near the Humboldt Sink the Reed draft animals give way to exhaustion.  The Reed provisions are loaded into the Graves family wagons.   <br /> <br />Except for berries and wild onions, Jim Reed and his companion, Walter, are out of food when they set out from Truckee Meadows.  Walter wants to shoot a horse.  (Snyder was killed because Reed was furious with him for abusing animals.)  Charlie Stanton and  McCutcheon find them.  Walter is too sick to travel.  He is taken in by an Illinois family.  Jim goes off with two traveling men.  It has been ten weeks since Jim left Fort Bridger.   <br /> <br />Coming overland the Johnson cabin is the first stop.  Land costs less than a penny an acre.  Jim arrives at Captain John Sutter's place.  He explains that his wife and children are suffering in the mountains.  Supplies have run low.  McCutcheon arives.   <br /> <br />The Donner Party, traveling, is isolated.  The party has turned into a scattering of wagons and there is the snow.  The Summit Trail is too deep in snow for the oxen.  Jim and others start out on a rescue mission.  They have to turn back.  Sutter is moved by the gall and the plight of the two men, Reed and McCutcheon, the husbands.  McCutcheon sets out for Sonoma to seek the help of ranchers there.  It is known in the area that the Donner Party was the last group to set out that year.   <br /> <br />The Donner Party reached the Summit Trail twenty four hours too late.  People in the party moved into cabins.  When snow went up to the roofs there was not more hunting and there was no more game to eat.  There was no leader because George Donner was five miles back.  A snowshoed party of fourteen people left Donner Lake to try to get through the pass.  Hunger has no boundaries.  The Reed party at the lake suffered hunger.   <br /> <br />Belatedly four rescue teams arrived at the behest of Jim Reed and Bill McCutcheon.  The Reed family survived the ordeal entire, an unusual result.  This is a good retelling of the Donner Party tragedy.	2005-10-09

As a big student of the War of 1870-71, I was a bit skeptic when I saw this was a historical novel, especially one that was a political commentary. Well, my skepticism was destroyed after about 15 minutes of reading this book. Not only is the author a veteran of the war, his style is SO engrossing I didn't stop reading until I finished the entire book! <br /> <br />The amount of details that are in the narritive can only come from someone who participated in the historical events that are narrated. Zola's characters are easy to identify with, and anyone can pick one character and say \\"yeah, that's me\\" as they read the story.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in the F/P War or French/European culture/life of the Second Empire.

Readers who like a little subversion with their science fiction, however, will find much to recommend this book. In her first novel, Mitchell has taken the most tawdry tropes of space opera -- women of Earth abducted to serve strange alien masters! beautiful hypersexual slave girls! robots with souls! -- and transformed them into a story whose value is far more than simple erotica.   <br />  <br />The cover tells you everything and nothing: a world whose sky might always be that sunset moment when the clouds have just caught fire, the streets and spires of an unfamiliar city, and the woman who runs. This is Elizabeth, and the city is Iyakk. The world is Vandhaqa, and Elizabeth is Taiyiha, human, female, enslaved to the enigmatic Adhal and their obedient automata, the Usahar. Like the other Taiyiha, she knows by heart both the epics of the Adhal and the Taiyiha's own laments; like them, she prays for the night when she will see Earth's moon rise and know that she is home; like them, she lives in shame and desire of what she has become. But unlike them, she has fallen in love: with a man who is no man, the Usahar XL176092, and their love will become the stuff of epic.  <br />  <br />Far from a simplistic love-conquers-all fairytale, Mitchell has created a skillful exploration of myth, truth, and fantasy. The Usahar opens on the premise that the reader already knows this tale -- or at least the one moment that has been alchemized into myth and common knowledge, Elizabeth's legendary run through the streets of shining Iyakk. Pay close attention to the narrative voice. By the novel's close, the oral tradition that has assimilated Elizabeth and XL176092 may be as crucial to the story as Elizabeth and XL176092 themselves. Life on Vandhaqa, meanwhile, is deconstructed from its initial appearance as a bondage fantasy into something much subtler and harder-edged. Sex on Vandhaqa may be free from the normal concerns of pregnancy and infection, but that does not mean it carries no consequences. \\"If I were destroyed,\\" Elizabeth thinks at one point, \\"it would be so much easier. If they would just make me nothing but sex . . . this wouldn't matter.\\" Mitchell's genius is that she knows: it still matters. <br /> <br />Karen Anne Mitchell's work may evoke such disparate classics as Tanith Lee's The Silver Metal Lover (Silver and XL176092 would have a lot to talk about) and the short fiction of Cordwainer Smith (see in particular \\"The Ballad of Lost C'mell\\" and \\"The Dead Lady of Clown Town\\"), but she has created a world entirely her own in Vandhaqa. It's not a place I'd like to live. I'm not even sure it's a place I'd like to visit. But I would certainly like to read more of its story: and The Usahar seems an ideal place to start.	2005-10-09

After months of studying, U.S. Marshal Gillian Logue finally has her first field assignment.  This is the assignment that will help her prove to her overprotective father and three older brothers that she is capable enough to do something with her life besides becoming a wife and mother.  Of course, the man she is sent to protect is exceedingly reclusive, and has been ever since the murder of his wife.  Finally tracing him to an island he owns off the Oregon coast, which just happens to be very close to where Gillian grew up, Gillian is dropped off there with a tent and enough supplies to last her two weeks.  She has to watch this man and protect him for two weeks until the trial of the drug lord who killed his wife. <br /> <br />Ever since his wife was murdered, Joe Morgan has lived his life on the run.  In order to protect his daughter, he left her with her maternal grandparents in Los Angeles, knowing they have the money to keep her safe.  Of course, if Joe hadn't gotten involved in this case to begin with, his wife never would have been murdered and he would still have his family.  It's been two years now and Joe still holds himself responsible.  He finally ended up here on his island off the Oregon coast with only his daughter's dog for company, which is how Joe wants it. <br /> <br />When Joe finds Gillian on his island, he can't believe it and is ready to run again.  Constantly fighting the attraction between them, Gillian eventually begins tearing the down the walls Joe has erected. <br /> <br />Will Gillian be able to prove herself with this assignment?  Will the two of them fight the attraction, or eventually give into it?  Will Joe ever get over the loss of his wife and be reunited with his daughter?  Will Gillian be able to keep Joe safe and deliver him to the trial? <br /> <br />SAVING JOE is a wonderful story of dealing with loss and bitterness.  Laura Marie Altom has done a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life, including all the baggage they've been carrying.  We have Joe dealing with the guilt of his wife's murder and trying to reconcile himself to her loss.  On the other hand, we have Gillian dealing with her feelings of never being good enough to do what she wants with her life.  Not only do these two individuals deal with each other's baggage, they're also surrounded by danger.  This is a wonderful little story, complete with heartfelt sigh at the end and I highly recommend reading it.  <br />	2005-10-09

Books	1	19	22	N	N	DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS BOOK	Reading this book made me feel physically sick.    Why? Because I know that business, commerce, share and property trading are complex, constantly-evolving and often technical subjects.    This book is a simplistic story, seemingly an auto-biography, that it took me an afternoon to read.    I hated the style of the book. If I want to read about wealth creation, then please give me weath-creation, not a story about the good old days in Hawaii.    It made me shudder to think of all the poor folk out there who would like to know how to make money, who might think this could show them how.    As I said, if you are a child and know nothing about the meaning of assets or liabilities, this could illustrate to you the basic concept.    However, alot of people seem to find the interpretation of even those simple concepts flawed.    If you have even any passing familiarity with economic/business concepts, I can't see this helping you at all.    I would see a subscription to a business/money/finance magazine as being of much greater value to an adult as these generally will tell you of techniques to actually try making money rather than just vague principles.    Yes, we would all like to put our money into appreciating assets and live off the passive income, but I don't see that happening in a hurry for anyone but an exceptionally lucky few.    Having said all of that, this book and the whole rich dad/poor dad series is cleverly marketed, but that doesn't make it a good book, it just adds to my sense of nausea about it.    Because the book is so non-specific and basic, it is successfully marketed around the world.    An example being that I bought it in a thrift shop here in Australia, read it in an afternoon and then sold it for a few dollars more.    I guess that's about the sum value of this book.    I'd suggest anyone interested in this book should do some research and read some of the less-than-glowing reviews - they are alot closer to the mark than the hundreds of five-star reviews on Amazon. Could almost make you suspicious.	2005-10-09

While `other' people toiled away in minimum wage positions, we were being assured job security and lots of perks to boot. College graduates were guaranteed a place in that company until their retirement from the company. They had made it in the world---or so they thought.<br /><br />Economic realities are delivering an abrupt wake-up call.<br /><br />In American society, making a profit is the bottom line of any corporation. This pursuit has recently led to layoff of white-collar workers in record numbers. The `downsized' workers had not done anything wrong except for being on the company payroll when it was trying to cut every corner imaginable.<br /><br />Now many of the same workers who had assumed they would not need or even supported policies which attacked social services are finding themselves having to use them. It is disorienting for these people to recognize they need to apply for public assistance and other programs which were once presumed to exist for `lazy freeloaders'. They are quickly trying to return to the White Collar world, but finding those jobs are much easier said than done.<br /><br />Smelling blood in the water, a veritable cottage industry of consultants and agencies opened up to theoretically help the newly-unemployed regain their corporate footing. Ehrenreich says theoretically because otherwise then those companies themselves would be out of their jobs. Therefore, they systematically keep clients just hopeful enough that `only' if they do the right things will they be able to get a job. The all-critical catch is the seminar trainees are rarely able to do things as well as the trainer admonishes them to.  This bittersweet cycle is punctuated by the ever-perky organization staffs.<br /><br />I read this book while my own father and his peers are among many of those whose experiences are being described through the text. She never interviewed them, but Ehrenreich's words echo their experiences.  Who you know and then what those people can do for you is often more important to present-day job hunts than your prior education and/or job experiences combined. Finding a job occurs more through personal connection (the `friend of a friend' avenue) than employment agencies or even reading the `classifieds' section of your local newspaper.<br /><br />The college transcript has decreased in importance, even though they are still used to some extent in order to screen job candidates in some cases. However, the book also expertly captures the paradoxical frustrations which many people-supposed to be America's `elite' are instead feeling. If they really had made it in American society, why do they have to look so thoroughly for any job (never mind the `dream') and worry about basic subsistence?<br /><br />In these respects, Ehrenreich's book is a logical extension of \\"Nickeled and Dimed\\". It illustrates that current American socioeconomic policies hurt most people and we will very soon be a nation of the very wealthy 5-10% while the majority will end up living in abject poverty despite our education, our skills, and/or work ethic.<br /><br />America's current national unemployment policies almost exclusively reference the working class because America does not want to admit that such a large percentage of its white collar workforce is vulnerable to being laid off. Pretending that downsizing only happens to `other' people in an already highly competitive economic class is much easier than admitting the system itself is long overdue for overhaul.<br /><br />Ehrenreich is a powerful writer specifically because she transforms `abstract' economic concepts into human interest stories---which connect with the readers. Her books are ultimately uplifting because while documenting current problems, she also foreshadows an America where those very problems are solved.  I'd recommend this book for public and college libraries. It is also an excellent comfort book for the white-collar worker and/or their families who are facing the circumstances described in this book.families who are facing the circumstances described in this book.	2005-10-09

As Children's Ministry Coordinator, I've searched endlessly for a good, long-term use, devotional/lesson book for my 5th/6th graders.  With ages ranging from 9 - 13, it's been hard finding a publisher who makes lessons that will appeal to everyone.  This one is great!  The devotions are quick and easy to prepare, incredibly doable on a tight budget (can I get an amen!?), and most importantly, FUN!  Devotions are divided into sections: \\"About Faith\\", \\"About Friends\\", \\"About Families\\", \\"About School\\", About MY World\\", About Special Days\\".  You can also search by scripture reference in the index or by theme.  Each devotion has a Title, theme, scripture reference, summary, preparation (you'll need), and body.    Instead of the same format again and again, inventive object lessons utilizine food, media, arts, discussion, independent work, action, and more to teach important ideas.  Some of my favorites include Power! (pg 8), Re-Paint-ance (pg 15), and Cash Stash (pg 60).  Power! is about the Holy Spirit's power in our lives, an invisible force moving us forward.  Kids will create a hovercraft out of plastic soda bottle necks and plastic foam bowls.  A quick puff into the mouth of the bottle and the bowl lifts up and floats along.  Re-paint-ance talks about - you guessed it - repentance.  Kids will paint over old paintings (from a thrift store or such).  In art circles, this is called \\"pentimento\\", an Italian term meaning \\"repentance.\\"  It describes the practice of painted over a pre-existing painting, showing that the artist ha changed his/her mind about the first painting.  Cash Stash accomplishes two things.  First, kids will discover whether they make tithing and giving a priority and second, it will teach them to budget their money.  Each kid (or group) gets a handful of Monopoly money or photocopies of the money printed in the book and instructions to make a budget for this money.  This is a definite MUST HAVE for all Sunday school programs with a preteen class.  You'll love it!	2005-10-09

Books	4	33	43	N	N	I'd Rather Read "Millionaire Republican" Than "Broke Democrat"	The Title of \\"Millionaire Republican\\" alone caught my attention. I always wanted to acquire wealth but was too busy working a regular 8--6 job. I had no time to make any serious money. I've always \\"claimed\\" to be a Republican, but maybe only because of my Father. He was Air Force, a straight-arrow Republican and a devoted Christian. So I voted Republican, but was too busy working to really ever practice any Republican principles to obtain my goals. Goals are just dreams with deadlines and thanks to Wayne Root's new book- from this moment I will have a real plan for my life. I am a first-time Amazon reviewer. His book made that special of an impression on me.  The 18 Republican secrets were so common sense. I should have known and done most of them- but who has time to think clearly when you work so hard.  I'll know in time if I am successful at this new plan...but at least today I feel some success because I am doing something about it. And I would rather <br />follow a book Titled \\"Millionaire Republican\\" than \\"Broke but still a Democrat.\\" By the way, I find it funny how vicious some of the reviewers are- personal attacks. It's obvious they never even read the book. Just jealous or bitter liberal Democrats trying hard to ruin a great man. The more these liberal scum attack- the more I know this book must scare the liberal left. Anything they hate is on my \\"Must Do\\" list!	2005-10-09

Unfortunately his overly positive approach does not present an accurate view of the field. Telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis; to hear Rhine's account you'd think these were all proven. If a tested phenomenon has been reported positively twice, Rhine considers it verified, no matter how many negative studies have been done, no matter allegations of experimental weakness, data manipulation and subject and experimenter fraud.<br /><br />Not one of the phenomena Rhine discusses can be routinely verified under adequately controlled conditions to this day. If people could see hidden objects and influence events such as the roll of a die, Las Vegas would have been bankrupted long ago.<br /><br />Since Rhine's discussion of paranormal phenomena are so flawed, the later chapters on social, scientific and religious implications are worthless.<br /><br />If you are looking for Rhine's \\"Galileo wannabe\\" moment, it's on page 156 of the William Sloane version of the book.	2005-10-09

While one may encounter shadows of post-diasporic experience in the stories, \\"Casual Water\\" and \\"Yellow\\", Lee does not preoccupy readers with plot lines most often associated with the work of more commonly known Asian-American writers. <br /> <br />Instead, he illustrates well the various issues assimilated Asian-Americans face as they live in a country where occasionally, they are reminded of their immigration status, regardless of whether they have been born in the United States. For Lee, race politics includes a Chinese thug who questions his Korean-American attorney about his white girlfriend in \\"Voir Dire\\", presuming that a white girlfriend automatically indicates a form of race treachery. Annie Yung, in the delightful, \\"Lone Night Cantina\\", assumes a cowgirl identity only to find herself facing the problems with assuming an identity that is not authentic to her person.  <br /> <br />Some Asian-American students will react to Yellow by arguing that they do not find Lee's characters \\"Asian\\" enough which begs the question: What does it mean to be Asian/Asian-American and what are the risks of narrowly-defining characteristics that ultimately lead to essentialism. Feminists have been right to point out how essentialism damages women and similarly, readers can bring their assumptions to the book so long as they understand that reading Lee's work may cast new light and perhaps, widen the spectrum of race representation. Readers who presume to know what \\"Asian\\" is may find themselves struggling with Lee's honest portrayal which avoids reinforcing images of Asian-Americans as perpetually struggling, self-hating, or striking nationalistic attitudes. Marked with a fluidity of language and expression, Lee's affection for his characters allows them genuine epiphanies without sentimentalism.  <br />	2005-10-09

I found it more interesting from an abstract, symbolic, 'flashback to those thought provoking discussions in freshman-lit' kind of way. There was the modern day Romeo and Juliet angle, the commentary on today's political world, the parallels that I assume the author was trying to draw between Blake and Melissa's dad (i.e., what made one act admirable and the other criminal). <br /> <br />As with many books of that nature, however, I didn't connect with it on a more basic level. The characters didn't seem real to me - as someone already mentioned...Melissa gets a 1450 on her SATs and we're supposed to believe she is THAT clueless?. Dick and Rosemary and walking stereotypes and Blake himself remains an elusive character. It would have been nice to see some kind of character development, maybe Melissa discovering that her parents aren't as one dimensional as she thinks, but it never happens. <br /> <br />A good book for a long philosophical discussion in a book club or English class, overall.	2005-10-09

We also learn about rhyme and rhyme-schemes, nor is the relation of text and music neglected.

Iola (our heroine) is being forced to marry an old man.  Her family is thrilled since Lord Stoneham will offer her a title and comfortable life.  But he is old enough to be her grandfather and Iola is NOT thrilled!  Having been raised by a loving nanny who still keeps in touch, Iola runs off to ask her advice.  I won't spoil the part where she visits the nanny.  It turns out to be a unique situation.  I will tell you how descriptions of Nanny sharing fanciful stories and love to Iola as they reminisce about her childhood show how this wonderful woman shaped Iola into a lovely young lady.      <br /> <br />Iola ends up as nanny to a sweet little girl who acts so grown up.  (How Iola happens to get this position is part of what you must read in the visit to Nanny).  Lucy (the little girl) has a very rich father, Sir Wolfe Renton.  He cares about Lucy (but is not over-attentive) and does not want her head filled with fanciful stories and informs Iola of this.  Iola tries not to pass on her imagination but is unsuccessful.  She also comes to love Lucy.  Lucy soaks up the affection like a sponge.  There are some funny situations as a very precocious Lucy converses with Lady Isabel, a rather conniving woman who desires to be Sir Wolfe's mistress (and perhaps blackmail him also).   <br /> <br />Throw in beautiful locations as the \\"house party\\" of Sir Wolfe sails upon his yacht to the south of France and the adventure of a kidnapping and you have an amusing afternoon read.

There are many references to Japanese pop culture, and a translation guide in the back to explain jokes and translations that English-speaking readers might not understand.  It's reads right-to-left, like all good mangas should, and has a preview of the next chapter (in Japanese, not translated) in the back. <br /> <br />So, there's my two cents.  If you love unique, whacky mangas with a good balance of humor, romance, and maybe a bit of angst, this is definitely the way to go.	2005-10-09

It may have been said previously, but let me assure you that this is no farce. Eric Pepin is the real deal ladies and gentlemen. If you have been looking for something, searching this world for truth, then look no further. This book will start you on your journey, and if you so desire, Higher Balance will help you along the way. This is a golden opportunity for anyone who has felt that there is something beneath the surface, something more to their existence than what they see, taste, smell, touch, or hear. Major kudos to everyone at HB, especially Eric. Someone said in another review that this book is just a plug for more high-priced stuff. In truth, they are NOT in it for the money, but must charge simply because they have to keep their doors open and continue to provide for the services they offer. Handbook of the Navigator is the starting point of the journey that will lead to so much, it up to you whether or not you pursue it. Much love guys and thank you so much for everything, hopefully i'll get to see you again sometime soon.	2005-10-09

The odd think about conspiracy theorists is how they build layer after layer of 'proof' on spurious sources - a house of cards of inference based, in the long run, on myth, hallucination, and too much moonshine. Michael Barkun does an excellent job of debunking the conspiratorial mindset and showing how this false layer of belief has been used to support many of the atrocities of apocalyptic thinking and behaviour. <br /> <br />Barkun's theses are simple presentations of the lack of any concrete proof behind the rambling raciocinations of the paranoid minority.  And that, if anything, it is the ethnophobic radical right which has seized on fevered imaginings like those of F. A. Ossendowski to further agendas that would be inconceivable except in the context of a terrified fear of God's final reckoning.   <br /> <br />Barkun uses good sense toblow back the dark clouds of conspiracy.  This is a breath of fresh air.  One can't help but wonder if the world would be a saner place if more people read enough of books like these to maintain a health scepticism when dealing with apocalyptic fantasies.	2005-10-09

PEEF and his best friend share summer days filled with adventure, fueled by imagination. They escape from a stampede of Dinosaurs, are chased by Tyrannosaurus Rex. And just when they believe they are safe, the Aliens bear down on them. They reach safety with seconds to spare. Then, when it appears safe, spies appear and the best friends must get away by bike if they are to survive. Whew! It's time for a rest. But their day of adventure is not over yet as bath time brings them to Pirates Cove and a sunken ship. Life is good for the two friends who end their day, snuggled together in bed wishing for other adventures. <br /> <br />The best friends' summer play ends and school begins, bringing a new friend into the picture. The new friend thinks PEEF is for babies. And PEEF's best friend rejects PEEF for his classmate. It is a sad day. But PEEF's best friend soon realizes his mistake and is filled with guilt and sadness. And PEEF loves his friend so much he forgives him.  <br /> <br />PEEF and his Best Friend is a story of love, forgiveness and reconciliation. It is real life from the perspective of a child. I love the PEEF books. They are entertaining and contain an important message for all of us. The illustrations are stunning and beg to be touched. All of the PEEF books are important additions to a child's library.

Montaigne was a humanist and a skeptic in his philosophical approach, and essentially looked at his own experience as the first topic for examination always.<br /><br />The book of Essays was one he worked on periodically throughout his life, issuing different editions, the first of which appeared in 1580.  Montaigne's style of writing is sometimes stream-of-consciousness, sometimes structured in more formal styles.<br /><br />Montaigne's stated task in his preface to the reader is for self-examination, but it becomes very clear that Montaigne sees himself as an 'everyman' character.  He strives for full-disclosure; indeed, he writes that were he another culture 'which are said to live still in the sweet freedom of nature's first laws', then he might have appeared naked.<br /><br />The particular essays included here are as follows:<br /><br />* Of Idleness<br /><br />* Of the Education of Children<br /><br />* Folly to Measure True and False by Our Own Capacity<br /><br />* Of the Inconsistency of Our Actions<br /><br />* Apology for Raymond Sebond<br /><br />* Of Repentance<br /><br />* Of Husbanding Your Will<br /><br />* Of Physiognomy<br /><br />* Of Experience<br /><br />Montaigne's essays show a pessimism and skepticism, perhaps based on the kinds of conflicts between Catholics and Protestants going on, in France and elsewhere, as well as the periodic flare of plague.  He was a humanist who saw cultures as having value internal to themselves and preferred to not universalise morals, laws and other ideas.<br /><br />Montaigne was sometimes conventional in thought (seeing marriage as necessary for children, and distrusting the idea of romantic love), but other times he was very much a free thinker (particularly when it came to religious dogma or absolutist kinds of philosophical paradigms).  Montaigne had respect for those who followed religious codes and ways of life, but distrusted those who tried to impose such ideas upon others.<br /><br />Montaigne added to his essays twice in major ways, but did not strive for consistency or systematic ways of thinking - he declined to remove previous essays if they contradicted new writings.<br /><br />Montaigne is perhaps the most important French philosopher prior to the Enlightenment.  His essays remain popular because they have a sense of the modern and the current about them.t for those who followed religious codes and ways of life, but distrusted those who tried to impose such ideas upon others. <br /> <br />Montaigne added to his essays twice in major ways, but did not strive for consistency or systematic ways of thinking - he declined to remove previous essays if they contradicted new writings. <br /> <br />Montaigne is perhaps the most important French philosopher prior to the Enlightenment.

Instead of writing a highly sensationalised account, Mr. Stenn uses a lot of solid research and facts, not rehashing and keeping alive the same old trashy rumors and character assassinations.  He even disproves the most infamous urban legend of them all, the one about Clara and the USC football team.  What does emerge is the portrait of a very sad vulnerable tragic person.  Clara came from dirt-poor Brooklyn roots, with mental illness running in her family, moving often in childhood, picked on by her peers and terribly abused at home.  And like many abused children, she made excuses for it, believing they did it for her own good, that it was in her own best interest that her mother tried to kill her, that her father often beat her and once raped her.  Her luck really began changing when she went west and broke into movies, after winning a local talent contest at the age of sixteen, and for a time enjoyed a semblance of happiness.  However, her career began to decline in the early Thirties after a number of scandals (contrary to another urban legend, it wasn't really because of the coming of sound, although she did have a terrible case of microphone-phobia), and she finally left Paramount, feeling it in her own best interest.  During this time, she married Rex Bell, who for a time provided her with a very happy secure life, as well as the two sons she adored and tried to be the ideal mother to.  However, her past caught up with her and she eventually had to go to a number of doctors and psychiatrists, falling victim to the same schizophrenia that her mother and other female relatives had suffered from, and died at the relatively young age of sixty.<br /><br />It would be too easy for a biographer to paint a picture of Clara as a sleazy party-crazy bed-hopping woman of loose morals and ill repute who just got lucky, but Mr. Stenn instead paints a picture of a woman who was just a sweet scared vulnerable person who never really had a childhood, who just wanted love, security, and acceptance, and tried to get it in all of the wrong ways.  She deserved so much better than abusive parents, a manager who exploited her, a studio that rarely put her in anything but predictable formula pictures instead of more serious dramatic roles, a press that repeatedly made up disgusting allegations against her (whether of a sexual nature or not), people who still believe these ridiculous stories that were manufactured decades ago, and a society that didn't fully understand the schizophrenia she suffered from, the disease that fully began showing itself after she was no longer acting.man who was just a sweet scared vulnerable person who never really had a childhood, who just wanted love, security, and acceptance, and tried to get it in all of the wrong ways.

Let me start by saying I never took economics in college.  I took one look at the course listing and, frankly, got seriously depressed.  So I heard all the buzz about this book and I thought, whatever.  Not for me.<br /><br />Turns out this book is exactly for me (and people like me).  It's written in clear, concise language, it makes logical conclusions, and it reminds us that correlation is not always causation.<br /><br />There's been a lot of hullabaloo about the authors' discussion of the impact of Roe v. Wade on the declining crime rate.  What's funny is that my mom, a special education teacher in a public school for, oh, 20 years, told me the exact same thing about 6 years ago.  So I wasn't as shocked by this as other people were.  (Go Mom!)  In any case, this is a perfect example of how the authors turn assumptions on their heads to make a new, logical, conclusion.<br /><br />The section on parenting is also great, particularly for all those parents who are constantly stressed out if they don't read to their children the requisite 45 minutes a day (or whatever the experts say it is now).<br /><br />I love books like this.  It will make you think about things differently.  And isn't that what good reading should do?	2005-10-09

As always Miss Fuse's boxes are beautifully finished both inside and out and choosing the correct paper can add a great deal to the quality of the finished product.<br /><br />These little boxes consist of a number of sheets of paper slotted together to form each part and some are really not that easy to do.  The flower box and some of the other decorative tops are quite tricky to figure out and absolute accuracy is required in the folding.  Having said this I have made most of the boxes in the book and the instructions are in Miss Fuse's clear and easy to follow style.  All of the boxes are made up and photographed clearly in the book, both in a separate sumptuous gallery section and in black and white photographs alongside the instructions.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for a complete beginner but someone who has done some folding and has mastered the basic models should be able to manage and enjoy making most of the items in it.	2005-10-09

Basic construction, finishing, and even decorating ideas are included. <br /> <br />The center section is \\"tear-out\\" full-sized plans, printed on only one side of the paper. Fortunately, I always photocopied (and now scan and print). Finally came the project-by-project instructions with copious drawings of what went where. <br /> <br />Where the outside covers were not sufficient to show color pictures of all the projects (as in v.III), inner color pages were added. <br /> <br />I have the first three volumes. Perhaps some later reviewer can let us know of more. The pattern pages, on matte stock, are ivory with age, but not yellowed or browned. The rest is still glossy and white--good paper! <br /> <br />If I have any quibbles, they mostly come from the age of the books: I use Tyvek bits off envelopes instead of paper for the hinges, and have had to find my own brands of acrylic finishes. The author does assume you will use balsa wood, like a number of others. I have never had a good result in my crafting life using balsa: I always use basswood, which doesn't split as easily and doesn't crumble on the endgrain like balsa does. It works even better. Getting into the craft hardwoods now available has never seemed necessary to me, though I'm now contemplating it if only to refresh the hobby. <br /> <br />Now, would Craft Publications, Inc. kindly re-issue these and make themselves some money? I would cheerfully pay the cost of a six-pack or two of ordinary beer (the international standard of cost) for any missing volumes. The furniture is so well designed, the patterns so carefully drafted, and the instructions so clear that they are quite worth that price.	2005-10-09

Unfortunately, the examples used in the book are 'corny' and distract from the important concepts leading to unneeded text and dreadful thoughts of 'The clip joint' and 'the solar powered cookie oven'. The grammar used in this book is a bit strange; don't, won't, etc appear frequently. This is somewhat odd as bernake was a former Fed governor and abel is also distinguised. I think that, perhaps, the authors attempted to 'dumb down' the book and in the process managed to merely make it corny. I also am a bit appalled at the amount of space given to math - it seems the authors wanted it to be more 'accessible'. <br /> <br />I will agree that the 'real world' examples are both pertinent and informative. They were chosen very well. The footnotes are also welcome as the authors frequently simplify models. <br /> <br />This book could use some trimming and perhaps less talk about dog groomers and the like.

Walker's book fills in a significant gap in the forces involved in that theater by providing a military analysis of the Italian forces without falling back on the clichs that grew from the conflict.  He does not, and cannot, argue that the Italian army in WWII was great; he does put the army in its appropriate strategic and political context. In fact the first few chapters of the book provide a contextual analysis for the army in North Africa so that you can understand why the Italians did poorly, but at the same time know why they did well given their constraints -- something often overlooked in a theater where Rommel, Montgomery, and Patton made their names and became larger than life.     One thing to keep in mind is that the focus of the book is on the three Italian armored divisions that fought in North Africa -- Ariete, Littorio, and Centauro.  This is not bad given that this was a theater that required mobility to fight and survive.  Following the contextual analysis the balance of the book is a straight forward military history that describes and analyzes the performance of these divisions first as Italy fought alone against Britain, then as Italy fought with their German allies against Britain and then the Americans in Tunisia.	2005-10-09

When I first read \\"Vault of the Ages\\" it was an exciting  book; in reviewing it as an adult  close to 40 years later as an adult I find it still an enjoyable read. Looking back on the stories I read in my youth this had to be the first in the  series of this genre of post doomsday chronicles that I continued to enjoy...    This book  emphasizes messages about human responsibility and the importance of using science only for good almost as though accentuated with a bright yellow Hi-Lighter Pen.    The story is set in the Alleghenies roughly 500 years after a nuclear holocaust, Vault of the Ages tells the story peaceful farming tribes vs.  fierce warriors. Carl, our lead hero and son of the village Chief is responsible for trading with  the people from the ruined city to obtain metal and other needed materials form  the  remains of skyscrapers etc...      Carl and his companions discover a \\"time vault,\\" basically a large time capsule  remaining from the pre-holocaust civilization, containing numerous tools, books, models of apparatus and more depicting the  sciences that have since been lost. With the aid of   the newly discovered sciences and much common sense he is able to help his people.    In rereading the description of the 'VAULT' it brings a smile to my face when I look around our office, library and museum facilities here at the  Southwest Museum of Engineering, Communications and Computation here in Glendale Arizona.... I can imagine a facility such as this  being the 'VAULT' spoken of in this story. I wonder what the world will be like in 500 years and what part the material preserved by the museum here will play in it....    Ed Sharpe, Archivist for SMECC   [...]	2005-10-09

US	14244739	R2HA5ZJKLNMLQT	0684807610	438783610	Benjamin Franklin: An American Life	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A fascinating life	Biographies are usually judged on two levels: First, the subject himself; second, the quality of the description of this individual and the events surrounding his/her life.  Walter Isaacson could not pick a more fascinating person to write about, nor more interesting events.  In his \\"pragmatic\\" approach to life, Benjamin Franklin became one of society's top diplomats, scientists, inventors, statesman, and journalists (I wouldn't really refer to him as a philosopher, as some do).  His plethora of pithy maxims and practical inventions are truly remarkable, all the more incredible given Franklin's Founding Father status.  As Isaacson points out, Franklin was the only person who signed the Declaration of Independence, Treaties with England and France to end the Revolutionary War, and U.S. Constitution.    Isaacson also aptly describes Franklin's imperfections.  He virtually abandoned his wife and children by spending a great deal of time in Europe, half of that time on rather frivolous pursuits.  He loved to flirt with women, often much younger than himself, in a fashion that would certainly be highly frowned upon today.  Additionally, Franklin was pro-England for longer than any of the other great men that founded our country, and later fell in love (almost embarassingly so) with France.    With warts and all though, Isaacson successfully demonstrates the influence of Franklin's views regarding the virtues of democracy in general, and the tradesmen middle class in particular.  Unlike the other Founding Fathers, he had an unadulterated faith in the common man, and a distrust of the elite, and also managed to invent the lightening rod and bifocals along the way.    One of my favorite parts of the book is the last chapter, where Isaacson describes the evolution of different attitudes towards Benjamin Franklin.  Basically, more pragmatic eras admire him, while more romantic eras don't.  I would think that it would be fair to say that, presently, Franklin has been elevatedto Demi-God Founding Father status, together with Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, and perhaps a few others.    I have the same quibbles as some of the other reviewers.  I believe the book is about 50 pages longer than it need be.  It's not necessary for the author to repeatedly tell us about Franklin's views on religious tolerance, for instance.  The multiple descriptions of his flirtatious affairs with some of the women in France seem endless at times.  Also, I believe Isaacson sometimes overstates Franklin's importance in forming the nation's governmental form, although his leadership in securing France's cooperation with the colonies during the Revolutionary War cannot be questioned.  I rather doubt that he was so important to the Constitutional Compromise, though he might have occasionally smoothed over rough waters (as he liked to do with a \\"magic\\" wand which would release oil to calm a choppy lake).    Still, \\"Benjamin Franklin - An American Life,\\" is well worth the read, and should be part of any decent library containing biographies of important Americans.  Also, check out the Amazon review by Newt Gingrich.  He's a good writer, and I sort of miss his presence in Congress, even though he's politically well to the right of me.	2005-10-09

What happened at the San Francisco Zen Center is a riveting tale: sex, corruption, and spiritual enlightenment. I imagine the actual truth of what went on will never be known as each person involved tries to cope with their past.  So I suppose Downing had an impossible task in uncovering what really happened and that's my guess as to why he told this scandal in such a haphazard way.  Trying to follow the various personages as well as when events occurred is very difficult; Downing's chapters are just snapshots of events.  It's a shame because underneath the book, I can see glimpses of some fascinating people living in a unique time.<br /><br />Overall, the book was disappointing because there is so much potential to tell a great story.  You can see it in Chadwick's Crooked Cucumber and I think reading that book first will help a reader understand the San Francisco Zen Center and the remarkable people much better. Then come back to Shoes.  Another recommendation if you're interested in Buddhist scandal (Tibetan style) is Sherrill's The Buddha from Brooklyn.	2005-10-09

Rick Kupchella, author of Tell Me What We Did Today, is a TV news anchor and reporter in the Twin Cities. He's also a dad who wrote an important story to share with children about the everyday life of children. Warren Hanson is the illustrator of this book and of the classic, A Cup of Christmas Tea and the PEEF books. When these two men got together to create a storybook, it was a success. And it will delight children of all ages. <br /> <br />Life is made up of simple, everyday experiences. And sharing those experiences, real or made up, is a wonderful way for parents or grandparents to connect with their children or grandchildren. And that is what Kupchella's book accomplishes. It's a zany, rollicking, wild and fun ride into the real, the made up, and the big things and little things of life.  <br /> <br />I always enjoy rhyming children's books and those that allow children to interact. Kupchella's book does both. His prose is in rhyme and he asks silly questions that elicit responses, usually a Noooooooo, from the children. And Hanson's bright, big and bold illustrations are oh, so inviting. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Kupchella believes there is nothing better than sitting down at the day's end with your children and laughing with them. Reading Tell Me What We Did Today is one way to accomplish this. We recommend it highly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

Why no one ever goes to a philosopher for advice? <br />2.  Why one mother had this to say about her son the philosopher: \\"He's the kind of doctor who can't help anyone.\\"? <br /> <br />If you're curious about it, simply read the first chapter of this book.  Once you have discovered.what we have lost, you will be encouraged to read the rest of the book. <br /> <br />\\"In the beginning Reality was at once being, knowledge and bliss ...\\" began the the first sentence of the book.  For the purposes of this exceedingly short review, that phrase will be truncated to: \\"being and knowledge were one\\", on the theory that once you have those two the third will follow.  The important part about all three qualities is that they constituted the sacred.  But that was a long time ago in the era of the \\"primordial religion\\", long before even the first ancient texts of the Vedic scriptures were written.  The wisdom of that religion however persisted in the lineage of Pythagoras -- Socrates -- Plato -- Plotinus, and even survived intact for the few centuries after them. <br /> <br />The author details how Western Civilization gradually lost touch with the wisdom of the ages.  In the beginning, all knowledge was sacred, as well as art, music, dancing, and the crafts.  The beginning of the decline of philosophy from its pristine wisdom to pure rationalism started with the famous -- or infamous -- enunciation : <br /> <br />\\"Cogito ergo sum,\\" of Descartes, \\"I think, therefore I am.\\", entirely ignoring being.  Anyway, modern philosophy was born.  After that, we were treated to many \\"-isms\\", from nominalism to existentialism.  And, of course, Sartre and his book: \\"Being and Nothingness\\".  That was the final decree.  Being and knowledge were officially divorced. <br /> <br />Fortunately however, there has been a rediscovery of the traditional wisdom, the two most notable names in this rediscovery being Guenon and Schuon.  This book details that rediscovery and shows how not only is all knowledge sacred but how the arts and sciences are fountains of Grace.   <br /> <br />This is not easy reading.  However, it will interest and repay the reader with an interest in tradition as defined by Schuon.  All of the ills of the modern world, global warming, overpopulation of the globe, nuclear weapons, etc., etc., etc. can be traced to the decline of traditional wisdom.	2005-10-08

It takes place in the fascinating world of Neopolis, a city populated entirely by people with extraordinary superpowers.  The characters are the police force that keeps the whole city from spinning out of control, and Top Ten is the story of how they convict the guilty, protect the innocent (or the mostly innocent anyway), and expose corruption up to the highest level.  It's a great story.  Alan Moore cleverly and insightfully portrays the city's social issues, such as an unfair prejudice against robots, and problems of disease and prostitution.  He uses the medium of the graphic novel to its fullest extent in order to get his points across.  The art perfectly complements the story.  <br />He also creates a great deal of sympathy for his characters.  Every character, no matter how briefly they appear, has a personality, makes choices, and experiences the repurcussions of his or her actions.   <br />Also, the women in Top Ten are actually interesting and thoughtful characters, in contast to the plethoras of scantily-clad, one-dimensional, comic book superheroines in other comics.  Characters like Toy Box, Girl 1, and Irma Geddon are complex, and they contribute to the story not just by being part of the plot, but also by simply having interesting personalities. <br />Alan Moore's superpower is obviously to write amazing comic books.  Top Ten is something any reader can enjoy, not just hard core comic fans.	2005-10-08

I knew nothing about this book when I started reading it, but after two pages, I was totally hooked until the end. Even lots of my favorite books have had some dead spots that I just needed to get through, but this didn't at all. <br /> <br />The author is often compared to Neal Stephenson, mostly for good reason. This is like Neal Stephenson at his best with more realistic characters and tech and MUCH more heavily edited. <br /> <br />One thing I particularly loved was how the characters in the book that are supposed to be smart people, actually act like smart people. They are as complex as smart people tend to be in real life and they think a lot about what they are doing, rather than follow the plot structure blindly like robots in a movie. <br /> <br />The author has obviously spent a number of years in the computer industry and describes the people in it with an accuracy and fun insight that comes from more than just research. The technical details of the threat and the social aspects of the conspiracy are also totally plausible and make it really rather creepy.	2005-10-08

Much to one's dismay, one finds a whole parade of grief counseling peddlers. Garden variety touchy-feely advice. Precious little for people with brain cells in the right places.<br /><br />That is what makes this Kubler-Ross compilation an absolute treasure of a find. It is intelligent in its narrative of moments one goes through at times of deep sudden loss, and the kinds of things one can do or think to ride the emotional rollercoasters that inevitably ensue. The prose is sane, easy to identity with. There is a rich cornucopia of examples and real life experiences that go to great lengths to cushion the self-doubt one could quite easily feel while indulging in a book on the subject.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this muddle-through read highly enough. A smart, sensitive companion. Look for the paperback if possible, there is one. As you are reading this review, may I also offer to point out that life's curveballs may appear random at times, with very little explanations offered for unpleasant things one has to live through, but life goes on. You will get through it. Best wishes.	2005-10-08

This book couldn't get more mixed-up with the whole situation about Brad Atwood and his ranch. Especially when Lindy reveals to her daughter her past with Brad. And how she disapproves of her spending time with her biological father. Then comes the exciting exit to the book with Major in a ravine and DJ hanging onto a cliff branch for dear life. That hopeless situation and how she got out of it really keeps the reader intrigued. DJ, still as bold as ever, with even more thoughts to keep her occupied, helps you explore yourself as a teen even more. The concept and lessons in these books with such complex characters are so deep that these can teach the young and old about something more than nothing. Out Of The Blue, this book, appropriately named, was one of my favorites in the series. Simply out of the blue.	2005-10-08

I think it unlikely because they were released within a couple years of each other.  The plot is very similar: a group of boys and girls are stranded with no hope of rescue and have to learn to govern themselves.  In Lord of the Flies, the students are prepubescent (to avoid the \\"hormone\\" issue) while Heinlein tackles it head-on: these are hale and hearty men and women from 16 to 22 who are sent on a survival test (because it's science fiction, on another world).  They are allowed whatever they want on the test, but the best students know their best weapon is between their ears, and go through mainly with knives and other non-perishable material.  However, their \\"warp gate\\" home never materialises at the end of the test, and they have to eke out an existence, assuming catastrophe at home has left them stranded forever. <br /> <br />Overall, I think Heinlein deals with the situation far more elegantly (and realistically!) than Golding. The point of both books is not whether they make it home, but how they adapt to their situation.  They are trapped more irrevocably than the island-dwellers in Lord of the Flies ever could be - a way gate requires an atomic pile to drive it.  The kids set decide to set up a \\"colony\\" and make the best of their situation.  Heinlein allows them to dislike each other, to fight, to marry, and in every way act like real people.  Sure, they still talk in early Heinleinese (they sound like they escaped from the set of Leave it to Beaver), but this was originally conceived as a juvenile.  The first few chapters are the worst for this - once the hero lands in the new world for the start of his test, Heinlein changes tone to a more readable and less saccharine style.  There are also some weird inconsistencies at the beginning, such as the students being unwilling (or unable) to form teams for the duration of the test - wouldn't you be stupid not to form a team? <br /> <br />However, once the story starts going and the kids start organising themselves into a society, Heinlein does a masterful job of protraying a realistic and interesting resolution to the problem.  Alliances shift, people don't like each other but get along because they have to (or die), people pair off in marriage, some are sexist or racist, etc.  Heinlein does tend to philosophise in his books, but it's mercifully absent (for the most part) here - he lets the situation and the characters speak for themselves.  It makes for a fast read (the book is only 200 pages anyways), but an enjoyable one.  It's somewhere at the level of Starship Troopers and Double Star for weight of ideas and level of activity (there is no sex per se and little violence), but probably does not contain the level of insight of these two.  Having said that, it's certainly above the young adult stories like Between Planets (for which I have an irrational love) and Rocket Ship Galileo.	2005-10-08

This book is a study of Elizabeth Cady Stanton's final address in 1892 called \\"Solitude of Self\\" in which she feels the human condition we all suffer sometimes, loneliness.  When she went to London in 1840, the way she was treated made her declare, \\"I am only a woman.\\" <br /> <br />In this different perspective on woman's suffrage and such, the Civil War is called a \\"Revolution\\" of sorts, but it was a fight to the bitter end, a war to remember and which may never be over in people's minds.  She talks about the errors of the past, equality for all, and a century of wrong. <br /> <br />Elizabeth, from upstate New York and later Boston, was concerned with aboliton, suffrage, and the power of religious doctrine.  She spoke in the Grand Opera House in 1975 Chicago to a standing-room only audience.  She was a political activist of her time. This book is based on letters, diaries, speeches, and Mrs. Stanton's THE WOMEN'S BIBLE. <br /> <br />Vivian Gornick has written FIERCE ATTACHMENTS and APPROACHING EYE LEVEL previously.	2005-10-08

A few days later at the evening meal, Dunne suffered a massive and fatal heart attack. In this exquisitely written and searingly honest book, Ms. Didion recounts her days in the next year or so and attempts to make some sense of it all. Her grief is intensely personal and solitary, yet universal. She remembers what started out as an ordinary day and asks the age-old question: \\"what if?\\" She returns again and again to the following:<br /><br />  Life changes fast,<br />  Life changes in the instant.<br />  You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.<br />  The question of self-pity.<br /><br />Ms. Didion may not provide a map for getting through the pathless wood of grief; she rather defines it: \\"Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. We anticipate (we know) that someone close to us could die. . . We might expect if the death is sudden to feel shock. We do not expect this shock to be obliterative, dislocating to both body and mind.\\" And even though I think she would agree with Auden that suffering ultimately is solitary, what she has written can offer consolation to all of us as we can see ourselves and our own struggle with loss in her experience as she defines and differentiates between grief and sorrow: grief is passive but mourning, \\"the act of dealing with grief,\\" requires attention. There are her coping mechanisms-- she avoids as best she can revisiting any place or event (\\"the vortex effect\\") that will trigger a connection between either her husband or daughter-- and finally her attempt of letting go: \\"I know why we try to keep the dead alive: we try to keep them alive in order to keep them with us. I also know that if we are to live ourselves there comes a point at which we must relinquish the dead, let them go, keep them dead.\\" Emily Dickinson, who said as much about death as any other American poet, would have called it, \\"sweeping up the heart.\\"<br /><br />THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING is also a beautiful love story of two people who were married forty years and worked together most of those years. On the dust cover of this book notice that all the letters of the words \\"Joan Didion The Year of Magical Thinking\\" are written in black except the letters that spell out J-O-H-N; those are in gray.

Or how often after a failure have you realized, \\"I told myself all along I couldn't do it?\\" Although our mental attitudes control our performance, most people use only a small portion of the mind's vast potential. In this remarkable book, two internationaly acclaimed clinical psychologists have combined their professional expertise to provide clear strategies and nuts-and-bolts techniques that can give you new power over your life.<br /><br />The methods presented here by Dr. Bernie Zilbergeld and Dr. Arnold A. Lazarus are the same mental-training techniques that Olympic champions and high achievers from all walks of life have found so effective in attaining peak performance. Mind Power is the first book to show you how easy it can be to use these techniques to set goals, reduce stress, and increase performance, creativity, and productivity - in other words, to help you shape your life into what you wish it to be.<br /><br />Millions of people have sought professional help to learn mental training, but Mind Power shows you how to learn, practice, and adapt the methods to your own. The authors demystify \\"mind power\\" for the layperson and illustrate through case histories and their personal experiences how it can work in your life. With step-by-step instructions that are easy to follow, they describe a variety of relaxation, concentration, and focused-imagery techniques, as well as exercises that let you master each method.  - from book's dustjacket	2005-10-08

Although most woman can have sex at other times, and most enjoy it, nature dictates that the only time it really makes sense to have sex is when a woman is ovulating. <br /> <br />In fact, almost all females in nature refuse to have sex when they are not fertile, except for humans and some other primates. <br /> <br />A \\"natural\\" sex life (i.e., 98% of human history) is as follows: <br />Marry at age 14-15 <br />Have child every two years until... <br />you have 10 or so children.... <br />or childbirth complications kill you... <br />and you die around age 30 due to a lack of modern medicine. <br /> <br />That is natural, anything else is humans intervening in the natural order. The authors need to focus more on the struggle of defying the desire to have sex when it would lead to children.	2005-10-08

And although he never sold it through the traditional book trade, he sold tens of thousands of copies. Why? Because it was the first book to really teach people in a detailed step-by-step manner, how to 'brain tan': the method used by Native Americans and American pioneers to make garment leather, and still the most practical way for you to successfully make really good leather in your own backyard. <br /> <br />Riggs made and wore his own buckskin daily for years before writing this book, so his instructions are both expert and very detailed about the nuances (and odd situations) that this craft can entail. His love of buckskin, sense of humor, and respect for the animals whose skins he is tanning shine through the pages.  <br /> <br />You'll learn step-by-step through words, illustrations and photographs; how to skin, tan, and then make clothing from the hides of deer, elk or antelope. You'll learn the 'dry-scrape' method of brain tanning (there is also a wetscrape method), and you'll have a great time doing it!	2005-10-08

A revelation...	I can't say enough good things about this book...  I read it after doing a web search of various symptoms and realizing my best friend who I had recently started rooming with had BPD. Let me tell you, it was the epiphany to end all epiphanies - realizing that I was NOT imaging things, being overly sensitive, or going crazy and that there was an \\"answer\\".  This realization gave me a sense of peace I cannot begin to describe.  Waves of shock went through my body as I saw symptom after symptom listed; some of the case studies were almost verbatim accounts of the rage filled blow ups and bizarre behavior I experienced first hand.  The authors call this realization \\"the light bulb effect\\" (perfectly put, by the way). I was fortunate enough to be able to remove myself from the BPD environment shortly after realizing what was going on, so while I can't vouch for the usefullness of the tips the authors give on how to deal with/live with a BPD person, I nevertheless count this book among the most important I've read thus far in my life.  The authors break everything down in clear, concise, easy to understand terms and give very specific and realistic analogies and examples to illustrate their points.  \\"Gaslighting\\" was the term that spoke to me the most.  This is when the BPD's [inaccurate] reality is different from, if not the exact opposite of yours.  I'll give you my own horrific experience with this:  I asked my roommate a question, she guessed at the answer but didn't know for sure if she was correct.  So I emailed my mother the question and she verified my friend was right.  So I showed her the email from my mother, the whole point being \\"Look, you were right!\\"  Well somehow this triggered a 15 minute long screaming, yelling, belittling, venomous verbal tirade that ended with her screaming \\"And then you show me this letter from your mother to tell me I'm wrong!\\"  THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT I SAID!  I started yelling at her to look at the email to see that I was, as I said, showing her she was right and she refused to look at the paper, actually turned her head away so she wouldn't see the printed words.  For whatever reason, she NEEDED to feel I was trying to tell her she was wrong and therefore stupid.  This trait is summed up by the authors in one simple sentence: \\"Non BPDs base their feelings on the facts, while BPDs change the facts to fit their feelings\\".  It was worth the purchase price for this sentence alone!  If you suspect someone in your life has BPD, this is a must.  Even if you don't, it's still a fascinating read.  There is a place in heaven for these authors!!!	2005-10-08

John Hunter was kind of like the Richard Feinman of the medical establishment of the 18th century. He pursued his own research, never buckled to peer pressure, and had absolute faith in his beliefs. At the same time, he was methodical, open-minded, and humble enough to realize that man bowed to Nature, not vice versa as many of his contemporaries would have wished. <br /> <br />We have John Hunter to thank for bringing medicine, quite literally, out of the dark ages and into the scientific age. Prior to Hunter's arrival, doctors believed that most ill derived from imbalances in \\"humors.\\" By bloodletting, drinking your own urine, etc, etc, one could have a hope of regaining health. Frankly, as Hunter quickly learned, this was complete and utter hogwash and he systematically set out to prove that many of that age's theories were plainly wrong. <br /> <br />Hunter succeeded in not only altering the understanding of medicine and anatomy in his time but also in inculcating a true scientific approach in his teaching role that reaches to today. He literally taught over a thousand doctors, including those who would go on to found the University of Pennsylvania's hospital in the capital of the American colony in Philadelphia. These doctors spread around the world in a wave and ultimately brought down the ridiculous knowledge base founded by Galen thousands of years before and replaced it with a rigorous, scientific one. <br /> <br />You don't need to be a doctor to understand this book but it helps to have a little medical knowledge, anyone who has taken biology at high school level will be fine. Hunter lived during an exciting time period too, overlapping with Napoleon's run on the continent, William Pitt the Younger as PM of Great Britain, Benjamin Franklin as plenipotentiary in France, and the independence of the American colonies. Hunter crossed paths with many people who shaped history. <br /> <br />This is one of the best books I've read this year.	2005-10-08

The pictures are fantastic, skeletons buried in their armour, rarely does one get to see how armour was actually worn. The breakdowns and detail of actual armour construction is immaculate and enables any competant armourer to reproduce the examples shown. The detail from an archeologist's point of view was a little too in depth for my interest but if you are that way inclined then great. Only issue I have is the \\"analysis\\" of some of the wounds seen, Mr. Thordeman seems to imply that this battle was unusual in some way, that the combatants fought with unusual fury. He sites one incident of one combatant having both legs severed by a single blow as an indication of some great fury and intensity. I only disagree as there are very few examples of medieval battle wound pathology to compare the Wisby corpses. It seems that the author is looking at the battle from too detached a viewpoint, forgetting that killing was the purpose of the people who showed up to battle that day. This is a small detail but supposition as to the mental states of combatants, by someone who has no first hand experience of battle is unproductive. Otherwise a great book.	2005-10-08

Even her worst book (and this is it) is better than nothing--some fascinating characters, a complex and stunningly-imagined world, and imaginative plot.      So what's missing?      For one thing, her usual abundance of secondary appealing characters; instead we have mostly sketchy, and unattractive stick figures like the unconvincing would-be \\"hallowed king,\\" Horseriver, and his unpleasant princess wife, Fara.  There are a few intriguing exceptions:  Jokol, the poet-prince visiting from a foreign land, and the gravid healer/mage Hallana, for instance.  Which just makes their rarity more obvious.      The middle of the book simply doesn't have a plot which could hold my attention.  The beginning and the end of the book come closer to Bujold's usual high standard, but the middle surprised me; it was boring.  I didn't think Bujold could write a boring chapter; it turns out she can.    If you're new to Bujold's work, Don't Start With This One.  If you haven't read Paladin of Souls and The Curse of Chalion and are fond of fantasy literature, they're delightful and I recommend them highly.  If you've devoured everything she wrote and don't want to reread one of her books the sixth time, The Hallowed Hunt is better than nothing.  ===========================  Upon re-reading the book--several months later--I would, if possible, give this little work 2 stars rather than 1.  As other readers have suggested, my high regard for Bujold's work make me compare this book to her wonderful works in general.  The miracle is that she usually performs magic herself.  No wonder that this middling-good work disappointed me.  It is worth rereading, and worth two stars.	2005-10-08

The Japanese garrisson, rather than meet the Marines on the Beaches, occupied prepared positions in a rugged, easily defended area called the Umurbrogol, positions which were impregnable to direct frontal attack. Rupertus tried to break Japanese resistance via the tactic of direct frontal attack. The result was thousands of killed and wounded for the Marines in return for no gain. <br /> <br />The Headquarters charged with taking Peleliu was III Amphibious Corps, commanded by Marine MG Roy Geiger. MG Geiger had two divisions, 1st Marine Division and 81st Infantry Division. III Amphibious Corps also had additional objectives, Angaur, Yap, Ulithi. 81stID's mission was to be the floating reserve, to provide reinforcements for 1st Marine Division should 1st Marine DIvision need reinforcing. 81st Infantry Division was not to be released for other missions unless Rupertus reported the 1st Marine Division did not need reinforcing. <br /> <br />Although he was taking heavy casualties and making no progress, Rupertus was reporting to Geiger that his situation was favorable and he did not need reinforcing. On September 17, 1944, 81st Infantry Division was released to go after the other objectives, Anguaur,Yap, Ulithi. Consequently, at a time when 1st Marine Division needed reinforcing, III Amphibious Corps had no reserve. <br /> <br />Gayle seems to place blame on 81st ID Commander MG Paul Mueller and upon Rear Admiral William H. P. Blandy, who commanded the task group carrying 81st ID, his argument seeming to be that MG Mueller and RADM Blandy insisted on carrying out the Angaur operation although the Army troops were needed on Peleliu. The real situation was, Rupertus did not like the Army, Rupertus did not want Army troops on Peleliu, and the 81st ID was not released until after Rupertus assured Geiger that Army reinforcements were not needed onPeleliu. <br /> <br />In World War II, in spite of their status as an elite force, the Marine Corps was not a very effective tactical organization. They were not very good at winning battles, and it was not uncommon that a \\"Marine\\" victory happened because of intervention of Army troops, and Peleliu was a prime example. It was not uncommon for Marines to blame Marine ineffectiveness on Army troops, and this book seem to be an example.	2005-10-08

This book has been a revelation to me on the order of Paul's vision on the road to Damascus. It seems that with this book, every question and misunderstanding of christianity is now explainable with this powerfull light of thruth. Truly, the motto of The Theosophical Society, which is \\"There is no religion higher than truth\\" is especially applicable when this book takes christianity head on. <br />This book is on par for me with my other favorite books on the origins of christianity, those being the works of Andrew D. Benson (\\"The Origins of Christianity and the Bible\\", and \\"The True Origins of Christianity and the Bible\\") and the great works of Acharya S. (\\"The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold\\", and \\"The Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha, and Christ Unveiled\\"). <br />My main criticism of this book is that I don't think Atwill went thoroughly enough into the matters concerning Paul and his transformation into one of the main christian saints, and explaining Paul as he was before \\"The War with the Jews\\" and his subsequent character make-over and his theology changes. The second criticism is there is no extensive bibliography, only a short one, and there is no index (which I feel is very important for people doing serious study). But there are notes for sources. <br />I highly recommend this book for those who are willing to read and consider works scholarly, critical or different from the typical christian apologist's view. Again, as that quoted motto says \\"There is NO religion higher than truth\\", and \\"You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free\\". These are especially meaningful in regards to this book. <br /> <br />My Subconscious Self	2005-10-08

However, the tax code doesn't change that much from year to year, so the book can still be worth reviewing,  especially for its strategic financial advice and citations of rulings. I would really like to find something more recent that addresses these issues.  Original review:<br /><br />If you are in an educational field and pay taxes in the US, you owe it to yourself to buy the current version of this book.<br /><br />I have used the annual editions of this book for years (since the early 1980s). It is a much better tax guide than the general tax guides I have looked at in the past (e.g. Lasser).  Unlike other tax guides I have seen, which walk you through the tax return, this one is oriented around financial issues (e.g. home office, expenses of attending school, retirement plans, tax sheltered plans, etc.) and is consists of tax basics along with interesting strategic info about how to deal with that issue.<br /><br />For example, other tax books will tell you how to fill out the form for a Roth IRA.  This book tells you why you should have a Roth IRA, and even why you should set up one for your children, illustrating the magic of compound interest over the life of your child by a graph.  In this sense, the book bridges the gap between filling out tax forms and financial planning -- this kind of strategic advice is useful no matter now the details of the tax code change from year to year.<br /><br />It is a cogent presentaton of all the tax issues that people in educational fields and school employees will encounter, such as how to deduct professional book purchases.  It is filled with examples and little-known IRS rulings that can make a real difference in how you handle different tax situations, such as what are the rulings on valuing used items that you deduct to charity.<br /><br />They used to have a book \\"Tax Guide for Engineers\\" that was oriented aroud the financial situations of engineer types of occupations.  That was also good, and had more info about consulting, but the year I was able to compare the engineer version and the college teacher version (early 90s), there was more information overall in the college teacher version.<br /><br />I buy the current edition of this book every year (that it is available), and use it to do taxes and financial planning.<br /><br />==> Much of this book is the same from year to year, but it is important to get the most recent version so that you have current information and analysis of current tax strategies.<br /><br />Fall 2008 addition:  I recently emailed the author and asked if there were going to be any more editions of this book, and he said no.

Crime lurks beneath the surface of this modern day teen-aged heroine's novel. A Nancy Drew of the new millennium, thirteen-year old Minerva Clark is a \\"self-conscious, self-loathing, freak show freak\\", forever under the supervision of whatever BIC (Brother-In-Charge) is left to watch the younger sister. Dressed in her favorite too big khaki pants and hooded Van's sweatshirt, the unsuspecting Minerva visits a local bookstore, Under the Covers, with her cousin, Jordan. On the way home, Jordan is arrested and Minerva has no idea what is going on. Not much later, lending herself as part of a science project, Minerva is all wired up, when, out of nowhere, lightening strikes and she is electrocuted. Strangely enough, this shock turns Minerva's life around, her shy self-awareness a thing of the past. Infused with confidence, the new Minerva is fearless, no longer a shadow of her three older brothers who serve as surrogates since their parents' divorce.<br /><br />Minerva wastes no time sleuthing the cause of Jordan's arrest, diving into a mystery that involves identity theft, a complicated money scam and a death. This empowered seventh-grader throws aside the usual teen angst and chronic self-evaluation, tapping into her inner Superwoman. The worst day of her life becomes a catalyst for change that is more than surface, the quirky teen taking some hard knocks but coming back with a healthy attitude. Speaking in the easy jargon of today's young teens, laced with cyber-speak, Minerva is an innovative and interesting character, her usual wise-cracking apropos and reflective of the electronic age. Teen-aged girls can readily identify with this spunky teen as she steps up to be counted, peer pressure and self doubts a thing of the past. Move over, Nancy Drew. There's a new girl in town.

I have taught from this book and also from the Addison Wesley (AW) series by Lial and Hornsby.  Those are much superior.

Sometimes the information needed is in a later lesson.<br /><br />Terminology used in this text isn't the same as in others.

These authors call that the 'general' form, and use various terminology for different forms of conic equations.<br /><br />Theorems and principles are often offered without explanation.  Some, but not all, have proofs in the appendices.<br /><br />The student solutions manual must have been written by 4 different grad students.  Successive solutions can have quite different approaches.<br /><br />Publisher generated tests have errors.  Be especially careful of the multiple choice problems.<br /><br />There have been serious typos, and often examples that can't be followed.  The trig chapters are the worst.<br /><br />In the instructor edition, the answers for the odds are in one place in the back of the book, and the answers for the evens are in another.  They should both be in the margins of the page where the problems are.<br /><br />The materials on the CD are dumb.  They simply match the student solutions manual, but are 'animated' to just offer them line by line.<br /><br />I'm not convinced the instructors on the video lecture series have actually ever taught the course.  They don't anticipate the common errors that students will make.  They simply show how to work out the problem.  HM can take some lessons from ZD net Whiteboard lectures.	2005-10-08

Mark Hayes, the protoganist, is a creative executive in Hollywood who can be moral, heroic, cynical, ambitious, driven, lazy, weak, confused, single-miinded, humorous and a variety of other contradictory things depending on which of the almost 60 short chapters one is reading in this book. As a character this may make Mark human, unfortunately as a narrator it only confuses the reader.<br /><br />The book's secondary cast is a set of boiler-plate characters - a movie mogul tyrant, Mark's hedonistic room-mate, a beautiful starlet turned crack-whore, street rappin' gang members, a pair of Joe Friday type homocide detectives and world weary yet enigmatic screen writers - who inexplicably show up and disappear. To spice things up there is some contrived tension with a maniacal rattlesnake, the return from the dead of a saloon owner and a couple of stand-offs with our hero and LA gang members. If this is all sounding a little like something Raymond Chandler might have written - well he's in here too, although why is unclear.<br /><br />The \\"mystery\\" involves the death of the movie mogul, (Mark's boss), who is murdered about a third of the way into the book and is solved by Mark, when \\"everything clicks\\", about ten pages from the ending. No clues, no pursuit of suspects - just the murder and then the identification of the murderer. The book contains dozens of vignettes, some humorous and some well written but at least in my mind it doesn't hold together as a story, a mystery or a novel.	2005-10-08

Books	5	17	20	N	N	A compelling exposition of judicial tyranny and viable solutions to reign in on it	In his book Judicial Tyranny: The New Kings of America, Mark Sutherland has assembled a wonderful cast of Christian attorneys, jurists, political scientists, and clergy who offer a rather perceptive analysis of judicial tyranny and our hope and means of restraining an overactive judiciary. Contributors include James Dobson, former U.S. Attorney General Edward Meese, former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, Don Feder, David Gibbs, Howard Phillips, Rev. Rick Scarborough, Phyllis Schlafly, and Herbert Titus among others. For too long, Congress has been complacent in the face of an overreaching, activist judiciary that has been out-of-step with the will of the great majority of the American people, and the judiciary has overstepped the bounds of its constitutional authority time and time again. Herein, the issue of an activist U.S. Supreme Court and federal judiciary is confronted with painstaking precision in manner intelligible to even the lay person. Meanwhile, solutions to overcome the tyranny of these black-robed deities are presented with amazing clarity. As Edmund Burke once declared, \\"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.\\" Complacency and ignorance will only allow the judicial oligarchy to become more entrenched and continue to foist its will upon us that is so frequently out-of-touch with the  sensibilities of the American people.    The framers of our Constitution hoped to establish an independent federal judiciary; however they by no means hoped to establish some new and peculiar government that might be termed an archonocracy-a national domination of judges. As John Randolph of Roanoke, in observing the activism and usurpation of power by the federal judiciary in his time quipped that \\"I can never forget that the Book of Judges is followed by the Book of Kings.\\" Thomas Jefferson opined, \\"...to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions [is] a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy.\\" Alexander Hamilton considered the judiciary to be the \\"least dangerous branch\\" of the federal government because it had neither the sword of the Presidency nor did it control the purse-strings like the legislative branch. In our time, the appellation of \\"least dangerous branch\\" to describe the federal judiciary seems rather far-fetched in light of twentieth-century history. While Hamilton made some compelling arguments about the virtues of an independent judiciary, he did not perceive the judicial tyranny that looms over us today.  On the hand, Thomas Jefferson and George Mason were very weary of an overactive judiciary and they offered prophetic insight that has bore bitter fruit.  George Mason warned that if unchecked the federal judiciary would destroy the state judiciaries, and encroach upon their jurisdictions. In his twilight years, Jefferson remarked that the \\"federal judiciary\\" was an object of \\"fear\\" declaring, \\"That body, like gravity, ever acting with noiseless foot and unalarming advance, gaining ground step by step and holding what it gains, is engulfing insidiously the special governments into the jaws of that which feeds them.\\" As John Taylor of Caroline opined, \\"A jurisdiction, limited by its own will, is an unlimited jurisdiction.\\"  The States coupled with the horizontal checks and balances within the federal government itself were intended as a bulwark against usurpation by any branch.  As Madison has declared, \\"ambition must be made to counter ambition.\\" Yet Congress remains complacent in moving against an overactive judiciary by any \\"ambition\\" of it's own and the States have been rendered impotent. The Executive branch generally refuses to interpose against encroachments against the Constitution by the judiciary, though it is sometimes committing its own usurpations. Alexander Hamilton reminds us that, \\"It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimatelydepend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.\\"  Andrew Jackson encapsulated the power of the executive to interpose, in declaring, \\"The Supreme Court has made it's decision, now let them enforce it.\\"  Jackson, of course, had no intent of give their judgment efficacy.  Interposition, of course, should be utilized to uphold the rule of law.     Some of the most powerful changes in civil society came not from the Congress but from an overactive judiciary. Justice Scalia in one of his famous dissents lamented that the Supreme Court had assumed the role of \\"a sort of junior-varsity Congress\\" in contravention of the constitutional design of the framers. While Hamilton's assertion that the judiciary is the \\"least dangerous branch\\" have proven erroneous in our time, in Federalist #78 Hamilton declared, \\"The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.\\" Since FDR's court-stacking in the mid-1930s and the activist push of the Warren Court in the 1950s, American conservatives have grown steadily more concerned about a judiciary gone awry. The U.S. Supreme Court in our time has sanctioned the removal of the Ten Commandments and prayer from public places, diminished local community standards of obscenity, trampled upon the sanctity of life in legalizing abortion throughout all fifty states with Roe v. Wade in 1973, and mor recently the court has trampled property rights by sanctioning eminent domain abuse for private politically-connected interests in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Judicial fiat now trumps the rule of law, and we have supplanted the law with the rule of men. The agenda of social liberalism is foisted on society most successfully by an overactive federal judiciary. With the most absurd and twisted reasoning, the Supreme Court made a steady, unforeseen move towards the legalization of abortion, such as the case of Grizwold v. Connecticut the court discovered an unenumerated right of privacy in the \\"penumbras, formed by the emanations,\\" of the Bill of Rights. Ancillary to that right of privacy was a concomitant right to infanticide. Justice Goldberg boldly state that such unenumerated rights were \\"rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people,\\" to give a locus of legitimacy to the court's arbitrary whelm.    George Mason, Thomas Jefferson and John Taylor of Caroline feared that the federal judiciary would devour the jurisdiction of the states, and become activist. Nonetheless, Congress has the constitutional means to counter an overactive judiciary by impeachment and by circumscribing the jurisdiction of the federal courts including the U.S. Supreme Court. Hamilton reminds us that it has been long-standing Anglo-American tradition that judges only hold their tenure in \\"good behavior\\" and this was a barrier to the \\"encroachments and oppressions of the representative body. And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws.\\" Yet Impeachment is hardly even considered to reign in on judicial tyranny. Phyliss Schlafly perceptively notes, \\"The Founding Fathers did not write a Constitution that set up a judicial oligarchy. They gave us a government based on the Separation of Powers. The mighty power of government was divided among three branches of government, and each is supposed to restrain the others by an interlacing network of checks and balances. Nothing in the U.S. Constitution justifies judicial supremacy.\\" Nonetheless, in our time, the design of the federal republic has unraveled, and judicial usurpation has made the assault on the Constitution all the more egregious. Justice Antonin Scalia has sardonically referred to his colleagues as \\"black-robed masters\\" who manipulate and distort the Constitution, and abysmally conflate their powers. \\"Within the last 20 years, we have found... the right to abortion, which was so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that it was criminal for 200 years [and] the right to homosexual sodomy, which was so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that it was criminal for 200 years.\\"    Judge Roy Moore makes it clear that all federal laws are not \\"the supreme law of the land\\" or by implication \\"constitutional law\\" merely because it was effectuated by a federal court ruling, but only those laws made \\"in pursuance thereof\\" to the Constitution as per Article VI. Even sitting Justice Scalia has expressed his disdain at his activist colleagues on the High Court: \\"So it is literally true... that the court has essentially liberated itself from the text of the Constitution, from the text and even from the traditions of the American people... and the Constitution is not a living organism, for Pete's sake. It's a legal document. And like all legal documents, it says some things and it doesn't say other things.\\" There are even recent precedents that show Congress has willingness to act against the judiciary's mischief, but the hope of conservative Christian evangelicals is that the Congress would do more and abate the judiciary's raw grab for power. In 2004, both House and the Senate passed the Marriage Protection Act, which became public law, which had the effect of circumscribing the jurisdiction of the federal courts and the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court-effectively barring those courts from hearing questions related to marriage. This was seen as a welcomed preemptive move by evangelicals to prevent a landmark ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing gay marriage throughout the United States while usurping the authority of the States and legislatures on the matter. Liberals in a knee-jerk reaction muttered that such legislation was unconstitutional; however, the Constitution vests Congress with the authority of circumscribing the jurisdiction of the federal courts and of abolishing and reconstituting those courts in a manner it sees fit. Mark Sutherland thoughtfully notes, \\"Congress has the power to limit what areas the judicial branch can rule in. Under authority granted to Congress in Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, Congress can place regulations and exceptions on the judicial branch that would prohibit the courts from ruling on certain issues and in certain areas. These areas could be religious freedom, the definition of marriage, or any other area that Congress chose to declare off-limits to the courts.\\" Moreover, at the impetus of our Republic, the U.S. Supreme Court possessed a much limited jurisdiction. Essentially, it was confined to cases where it exercised original jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction as per Article III, Section 2, \\"The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;-to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls;-to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;-to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;-to controversies between two or more states;-between a state and citizens of another state;-between citizens of different states;-between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.\\" Essentially, as per the Constitution, the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary was extremely limited. For example, two citizens of the same state could not be litigants in a federal suit since diversity of citizenship is lacking, and the federal jurisdiction only extends to cases where the plaintiff and defendant parties come from different states. The federal judiciary exercised jurisdiction over disputes between the states. Essentially, there aretwo main sources of the cases coming before the federal courts: \\"federal question\\" jurisdiction, and \\"diversity\\" jurisdiction. Earlier in the nineteenth-century, the jurisdiction of cases properly arising within under the authority of the States was considered inviolable and there was no higher court of appeal in cases originating in a state court than the Supreme Court of the respective State. This has, of course, changed as respect for states' rights and the Tenth Amendment has been greatly diminished, but it is within the power of Congress to circumscribe the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary to a manner commensurate with original intent. While the judiciary has usurped the powers of Congress and the States time and time again, it is within Congress' power to reign in on an overactive judiciary while preserving the benefits of an independent judiciary. We must activate Congress and communicate to our lawmakers that the American people are tired and alarmed by a judiciary whose edicts are seldom amenable to the more conservative sobriety of the American people. If Congress does not actively impeach overactive judges that subvert the Constitution, it can greatly curtail federal court jurisdiction.     All things considered, Mark Sutherland has brought together a provocative corps of respected scholars and legal thinkers who collectively offer an incisive critique of a judiciary gone awry while they offer constructive solutions for reform. They make it abundantly clear that we the American people do not have to be slaves to the edicts of these black-robed deities. Their adroit assessment of the federal judiciary is intelligent, rooted in a principled esteem for the rule of law and constitutional popular rule, and their solutions are constitutional defensible, practical and tenable. One thing is resoundingly clear, we must stand up to these demigods in block robes that contravene the design of our federal republic and offer outlandish decisions at odds with the will of the vast majority of the people. It is paramount that the American people awaken and voice their discontent to their elected representatives in Congress if we are to abate judicial tyranny. Mark Sutherland's Judicial Tyranny is destined to be a classic, and unlike similar well-written books by Mark Levin and Pat Robertson, Sutherland's book is unique: it is hard-hitting and much more multi-faceted on the issues it covers. Additionally, it represents a profound cooperative effort by a potentate of conservative luminaries from James Dobson to Roy Moore.    \\"The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.\\"  -Alexander Hamilton	2005-10-08

Tied billiantly together by the opening chapter (\\"The Trip\\"), this collection (novel in stories?) reveals the lives of four characters before and after their attempt to emigrate from Morocco to Spain. \\"Characters\\" scarcely feels like the right word here, though; these people (Murad, Aziz, Faten, Halima) are rendered in such detail, emotionally more than physically, that they seem real, and their respective plights seem absolutely real. Faten is a good example.

Later, in the fabulous story \\"Odalisque,\\" she has managed to get to Spain but has to work as a prostitute to support herself. The reader knows this isn't the real Faten, and comes to understand that the fanatic wasn't the real Faten either, and the resulting portrait of a struggling women from her circumstances is chillingly vivid and credible.<br /><br />One of the most rewarding books I've read in a long time.	2005-10-08

The richness and variety of language provided vivid word-pictures of the characters, surroundings, and circumstances in his books.  From the racetracks of New York to the scorching Arabian sands, Farley senior took the reader with him on dangerous adventures and breathtaking race rides.  His writing progressed, richened, and refined with each novel.  With Alec Ramsay, the readers grew up on the back of the Black Stallion.   <br /> <br />Then came Steven Farley.  His cooperation in the Young Black Stallion with Walter indicates that the erstwhile author passed the torch to his son with blessings.  Farley senior may have bequeathed the series to Steven, but he was unable to include the same literary flavor.  Alec and the Black progressed from a pair of unknowns to a respected force in the racing community during the original series.  \\"Shadow\\" very quickly kicks Alec back to square one in the racing community, still being called a 'kid' and angrily defending himself.  Books tend to set a tone right away, and I wasn't impressed.  It is impossible to separate the continuation from the original series, and therefore it is not possible to avoid comparing them.  Stick with Farley senior's books.  They are superior.	2005-10-08

It is a collection of two previously published works although there are reputedly about 20,000 new words included. If you already own either of the books, there is little reason to buy this volume. Otherwise, it is a good buy. <br /> <br />The two included books are THE SHIVA OPTION and INSURECTION. Reviews of each appear below. <br /> <br />THE SHIVA OPTION <br />THE SHIVA OPTION conludes the story begun in IN DEATH GROUND. The story and the options are just as horrific and the consequences are just as bad.  <br /> <br />Humanity and its allies face a war to the end with a race that will either eat every race it comes across or die trying. They cannot be negotiated with. They can either be killed or allowed to win. Killing them is not easy because they don't care about their own casualties. They have only a hunger and nothing can assuage it. <br /> <br />The space battles are well though out as is the strategy presented. They should appeal to fans of space battle. Like the predecessor, however, the real story concerns the hard choices of the leaders. <br /> <br />This is not a fun book to read but it is interesting and worthwhile. It also leaves open the possibility that more bugs will appear in later volumes. <br /> <br />INSURECTION <br />Insurrection takes place in the same universe as IN DEATH GROUND and THE SHIVA OPTION about a generation after the events of the latter. Humanity has been at peace but that doesn't stop nasty politicians from trying to do nasty things to people. Finally, a time comes when the people will take it no more and the result is civil war. <br /> <br />This book makes clear that there are honorable people on both sides of the conflict but the horrors of war are such that innocents are bound to suffer. Like the other books of this series, the action sequences are well though out and well written but the main lessons come from choices faced by the protagonists. Weber and White are goodat writing about space battle. They are even better at writing about political issues and human choices. <br />	2005-10-08

Emilio Salgari was one of the best adventure writers of the early 20th century, although he wrote only in Italian and never left Verona, the city of his birth.  I (and most Italian children) grew up reading these swashbuckling adventure novels; most were about pirates as noble social rebels with their own code of honor, fighting the bad guys by land and by sea in the Caribbean, Malaysia and other exotic locales.  Sandokan is no exception.  He's the ultimate romantic hero: the son of a Raja deposed by the British, he has his own island, Mompracem, from which he struggles against evil colonizers for the cause of good.  When I was a kid these books made me want to be a pirate! (Unfortunately the career possibilities were poor, so I became an anthropologist instead.)  Salgari's books took countless Italian kids to the far corners of the earth with their exciting, action-filled drama; it's great to finally see one of them in English.  More, please!	2005-10-07

If this is accurate, the most annoying thing our protagonist does is to go out of his way to engage the affections of an affection-starved gay man when he knows he will have to leave the country in a few months, and that the chance his boyfriend will ever be able to join him in the U.S. is remote.  This indeed sets up a poignant situation, but seems extremely selfish and irresponsible.  Middle-aged men, especially those with the amount of experience our protagonist is supposed to have, ought to behave better, at least if they expect us to like them.	2005-10-07
US	39569598	RSQNF8BE968M9	0674013905	925148876	The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A fascinating and fun text	How could one not love a book that deals with the Holy Grail by looking both at the Arthurian legends and the Monty Python films?  I finished this book last night, as 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', a film mentioned in the book, was playing in the background.  Actually, I bought this book as a gift for a friend (who loaned it back to me) as her family has its own Grail legend, with the lore of her family from Wales holding that the cup was (or may even yet be) in the possession of her kin.  As she returns to Britain in the winter to do some exploring, I thought this text would be a good primer to various issues surrounding the Grail, and Barber's text does not disappoint.<br /><br />Particularly in an age where popular literature has a re-visioning of the Grail being not the cup of Christ, but rather a blood-line, to look at the way the Grail has been portrayed over time is fascinating. The first section of the book examines some of the earliest literature about the Grail - it was not in fact part of the earliest of Arthurian legends, but later grafted on.  The French author Chretien de Troyes is credited with the first Grail story, who used romantic imagery and ecclesial symbols freely in this tale.  It seems to be an original tale, so far as Barber is concerned - he finds no evidence that this was part of a legend oral or written that was handed down.  Chretien de Troyes was author of many medieval romantic tales, and unfortunately did not live long enough to finish the one about the Grail.<br /><br />The story was picked up by later authors, most notably Robert de Boron and Wolfram von Eschenbach.  The tale became increasingly developed and embellished, continuing to draw in more and more characters - Perceval, Galahad, Lancelot, and more.  Not all of the authors agree with each other (just as modern interpretations in novels, films, and 'historical' works also differ with each other), and Barber does a good, ecumenical job at laying out the different issues.  But through the confusion, Barber draws forth these questions:  'Why should the new genre of romance aspire to take on the great problems of theology and the highest moments of mystical experience?  But they remain in the background while we turn first to ask our own version of Perceval's Grail question: \\"What is the Grail?\\" '<br /><br />Barber's second section is the most informative section, looking at issues of relics, legends, histories true and false, theological questions, and mystical images.  The Grail remained an ever-present image in the medieval world because of the natural association with the Eucharistic cup, present at church services throughout Christendom on a regular basis, all being believed in this pre-Reformation society to be the bearer of the actual blood of Christ.  The Eucharist is a piece of medieval drama and choreography as well as the centre of artistic expression (many churches and cathedrals also served as the local 'art galleries' of a sort, and also the place where music was performed on a regular basis).  The Eucharist was a source of nourishment, reminiscent of a day when the communal feast was a real meal, and symbolically linking to the kind of spiritual nourishment envisioned in many of the Grail tales.<br /><br />While stories of the Grail would fade in popularity as the church became worried about heresy and division (and thus tried to define a more narrow focus on acceptable kinds of interpretation and expression), the Grail idea was resurrected in the post-Reformation era, and again in the modern era.  If the second section of Barber's text was the most informative, the third section was the most fun.  It looks at different ways that the Grail has been presented in the modern world, both secular and academic-sacred, and asks anew the question, what is the Grail?  Perhaps there is no Grail, such as in the Monty Python film; perhaps it is a piece of knowledge or understanding, as in the film 'Excalibur' by John Boorman.  The revival of interest in the Grail coincided with interest in medieval, mystical and Celtic subjects; the cross-currents of influences in areas such as art and music extend to the idea that many find the opening musical sequence of a post-modern Celtic/British film like 'Excalibur' to be very fitting, not realising that it is Romantic German music from a Wagner opera, tied to a different kind of ancient legend (although Wagner would become a fan of the Grail retellings, adding his own with the opera 'Parsifal', which would explicitly link the Grail with sexuality and femininity).<br /><br />Barber himself confesses to this being a different kind of book from the one he envisioned writing.  'I believed that I would be engaged with pagan myth and the marvellous Celtic stories on which much of Arthurian romance is founded, and that the first shape of the Grail would be dimly discernible in the remote past.'  Instead, he found a treasure trove of theology, art, literature, even popular culture in the mix.<br /><br />There are indexes and appendices that make this book useful for the scholar, as well as generous notes.  There are colour plates which show paintings, tapestries and other works of art that are Grail-related, and many more grayscale graphics and prints throughout the text.  The bibliography itself is thirty pages of small print.<br /><br />This is a fascinating and fun text.Boorman.

This book does a very thorough job of being convincing about becoming vegan. The book talks about how chickens are crippled because their skeletons can't keep up with the enormous amounts of flesh they're genetically bred to grow. It talks about how unwanted male chicks are ground up alive as feed, how chicks are carelessly crushed underfoot when loading them, how the chickens' uteri are forced out of their bodies to be pecked at by fellow hens because the eggs they bear are too big for their bodies. Even being lacto-ovo vegetarian is contributing to this cruelty because this is what happens so the egg industry can flourish and provide us with cheap eggs. It talks about how hens are de-beaked because they are stressed into cannibalism, they are starved and dehydrated to force them into another laying cycle, and how they are exposed to levels of ammonia that it drives them blind. After reading this book, I have concluded that unless one raises ones own chickens for eggs and meat, there is no way to eat chickens with a confortable conscience. Even ritual killing supposed to be more humane is cruel, letting the chicken bleed itself out in pain and panic. Even if it were not for animal rights, the fact that the chicken carcasses have huge amounts of antibiotics, hormones, cancerous tumors, pus-filled innards...would be enough to convince me that eating the meat does me no good at all, karma or no karma. I've heard it said that cooking something in your toilet is about the same as eating a chicken...after reading this book, I'm inclined to believe what I once thought was just hype.   I would have given this book 5 stars but for the fact that the author doesn't really go into what eating these products over time could do to humans. I think that if she had gone into that, it would probably be more effective at convincing people. After all, nothing better to deterr people from eating too much meat than to tell them it's potentially cancer-causing. Which, considering they say you are what you eat...eating carcasses that had cancerous tumors...	2005-10-07

As a teacher of the Bible to graduate students desiring to be ministers and teachers, I often am asked how we can reconcile the Bible's statements about the creation of Adam and Eve with the findings of modern science.  And how does the universal flood fit in, along with the historic occupation of the various continents by human beings?  Most people have the impression that the two accounts-the Bible's and that provided by physical and historical anthropology-are contradictory.  They assume that the Bible is mythological at this point, intended to teach only spiritual truths.<br /><br />Who Was Adam? is a high quality work that presents a convincing case for what is called the RTB (Reasons to Believe) model.  This model assumes that the Bible, interpreted consistently in all the relevant passages, is historically accurate, and that Adam and Eve were two humans created directly by God about 50,000-100,000 years ago.  It also assumes the reliability of modern scientific investigations and conclusions, subject to correction by future discoveries.  It concludes that the RTB model agrees with these two sources of information.  In so doing, it favors the modern Out-of-Africa theory, that all humans descend from a small population in one location in the Middle East or eastern Africa.  It further offers specific predictions for future research which can falsify or modify the model.  This approach is unique in the modern theology-science debate and discussion.<br /><br />In several chapters Rana and Ross summarize the latest findings in paleoanthropology, including the rapidly developing field of genetic history.  Rana's specialization in molecular biology is especially evident in these chapters.  Special attention is given to the appearance of bipedalism and increased brain size, and a lengthy chapter demonstrates that Neanderthals were not human.  This book is a convenient collection of information from all the important scientific disciplines as they relate to the origin of humans.

From the first book (1916) with a young Ned Halloran all they way up to Ned's grandson Barry in her latest masterpiece 1972, Llywelyn tells the story of the Republican movement from the Easter rising to Bloody Sunday.  It's amazing how in 1972, she is able to approach all angles of the Troubles in Ireland.  From the facture of IRA and the emergence of Ian Paisley and the Provos Llywelyn takes the confusion out and shows the futility of Irish politics.  These books have brought to light a heritage that I have never been aware of and that has escaped my family over the generations.  I would recomend this book to everyone with an ounce of Irish blood or anyone interested in the troubled history of modern Ireland.  I can't wait for her next installment in the Irish Century series.	2005-10-07

The facts are that energy is limitless. the universe IS energy. It is all around us and regulatory attempts to conserve it are misplaced and will do more harm than good to the energy supplies. [by distorting the market forces that generate, distribute and utilize that energy efficiently]<br /><br />Huber utilizes well-accepted principles of economics to prove his many points. These include the fact that energy is abundant, virtually everywhere, and with technologies already in use, is accessible to man's use and that the more energy is used, the more can be found and utilized for any and all of the growing range of purposes to which energy applies.<br /><br />On top of that, attempt to conserve usually lead to increased energy use and Huber presents much data to support this.<br /><br />This book falls in along with the exciting Russian discoveries about the real source of petroleum and the overwhelming mass of evidence that we will never ever run out of oil. People who claim that we have peaked in our oil production usually say \\"discoveries have peaked\\". Well yeah, you know why? Because known reserves are now greater than they have ever been in our history. The known reserves are so vast it is a waste of time and money to explore for more and will be for at least 50 years.<br /><br />The most fascinating point in the book is the new discovery that North America - long criticized for our \\"consumption\\" of energy and concurrent emission of CO2 - now known to be the largest lane based CO2 SINK in the world. North America not only absorbs and recycles ALL of its CO2 emissions but absorbs huge qualities from the rest of the world!<br /><br />  see [...]<br /><br />[to put things into perspective - the world exchanges an annual mass of 150 Billion metric tons of CO2 per year. Human activity accounts for 8 Billion or 5% of that total.]<br /><br />The USA is also the most efficient user of energy when manufacturing and economic activity are factored into the total energy picture. A fact that Huber claims will put the USA is a very good position as energy demand puts upward pressure on prices. The more the fraction of costs that are attributed to energy rises, the bigger advantage the US has. IN fact another 20% rise in prices could entirely wipe out the cost advantage China has in the manufacturing sector.<br /><br />Examining policy, the book analyzes the real effects of energy policies that have been enacted. The effects of these policies are when viewed in total always make matters worse and are all counterproductive to either conservation of energy, reduction of pollution, or both. As Ludwig von Mises's discovered; all economic regulation is ultimately and inevitably harmful to the very goals it was emplaced for in the first case.<br /><br />Overall, the authors shine the harsh light of truth on the record of government interference in energy markets. The track record is not encouraging for future regulation.world exchanges an annual mass of 150 Billion metric tons of CO2 per year.

Like modern art, I can sometimes recognize the genius but still not want it in my house. This book was like that for me. I finished it last night, at one sitting, and was never bored. I have a master's in math (the protagonist excelled in math) and while I hope my social skills exceed the boy's (he was autistic)- I can certainly identify at some level there as well. In spite of all this, and of the fact that the book was written from the perspective (I suppose for the first time) of a 15 year old autistic boy, I did not find it endearing. I cannot help but identify strongly with the protagonist of a story, and if that person is an unpleasant character I find the experience distasteful. Of course the boy could not help it, but he was one of the most narcissistic individuals I've encountered in literature. The book reminded me in many ways of \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\", a book I also admired from a literary point of view but did not like the mood it created in me.<br /><br />The plot is less important than the style in this book, but briefly stated it concerns an autistic boy's attempt to solve a mystery in the neighborhood as well as write about it. The amazing, and I emphasize amazing, feature of this book is the ability of the author to write so brilliantly from the perspective of an autistic child. I've never known anyone truly autistic, so it is a bit of a presumption, but it seems to have been carried off perfectly by the author.<br /><br />A couple of asides that may illustrate both what I liked and what bothered me about this book. At one point Christopher (the boy, I don't think I ever got around to mentioning his name) discusses a math problem called the \\"Monty Hall Problem\\", that while seemingly intuitive was actually somewhat complex. Many math PhD's wrote in dogmatically protesting what they felt was an incorrect answer given by Marilyn vos Savant to the Monty Hall Problem, and just that many were shown to be wrong, regardless of the vehemence of their conviction otherwise. They were also convinced that it was very unlikely that so many of them, as the mathematical authorities of the country, could be in error. How about that?<br /><br />The other story, and I think revealingly related, comes about as Christopher explains a bit of why he is an atheist and gives a capsule defense of Darwinism. He then tackles one of the more difficult points, that of how the evolution of irreducibly complex organs/organisms was able to occur. The eye is often used as an example, as people ask what good would half an eye be, as an evolving species would need to have for a time on the mutationous road from blindness to sight. The atheistic voice (speaking through Christopher) points out that 50% of an eye, or even 1% of an eye, would be better than none and would still confer genetic advantage to be passed down to offspring. And this rather reminds me of the first story, because even though tons of scientists dogmatically hold this view, and scoff at those who question it, they are just as blind, if I may say, as those math PhD's from the previous story. Subconsciously or by intelligent design I don't know, but they make a verbal switch from eye to vision and then attack a straw man. No one argues that 50%, or even 1%, of vision is better than none, but for an irreducibly complex system, half an eyeball does not equal half vision, it equals no vision. This is obvious once pointed out, but as the experts are stymied by the limitations of their dogmatic ideology they care not see it.<br /><br />And this brings me to why I recognized this book was extremely well written but ultimately for me unenjoyable. I recognize this as a weakness of mine, and not the fault of the author, and that is why I think it deserves four stars and why I think most people will find it an excellent and unique read. I couldn't get past the sterility and self-centered world that the main character lived in, however. His inability to ever empathize made me feel as if I were reading the diary of a sociopath. I realize this to be a sign that the writer did his job exceedingly well, but a little too well for me to come away smiling.y and self-centered world that the main character lived in, however.

For years I've had a photocopy of this book that I've lugged around, so I was very happy to find this as a reprint edition. One of the great things about this is that the author has done her research, and tends to construct the clothing from simple shapes -- namely if you can sew a straight line, or hem, you can make these costumes. The bad part is that there are some very odd items in here -- one tunic has a flap that ties in place, and the woman's gown is constructed in a very odd way -- you 'can' do it, but the seams look very out of place. Still, the price is good for a begining reinactor, and will instill confidence to go on and make more complicated items.	2005-10-07

She'd been given the book when she had lost one of her babies.  I read it and cried - at that time we had just put down our little girl Sponge.  It just gave me a little more peace that our little baby was no longer in pain and having all the biscuits she could eat and with her other family members that had passed on.  The first line in the book \\"When dogs go to heaven, they don't need wings because God knows that dogs love running best.\\" That was our Sponge.  Hard to believe a kid's book could have such an affect on a person. <br /> <br />Sponge's sister Scotch is now 18 and she's getting up in years - walking slower, cataracts, you fellow dog parents know the routine.  I finally broke down and got my own copy of the book.  None of us ever know how long we'll be here, but this book is such a comfort to those of us with pets that our pets are not forgotten.  For those cat lovers, the author has also written Cat Heaven.  If it's anything like this book, another joy to have and I'll probably end up getting it even though I'm a dog Mom. <br /> <br />I have to thank the author for putting into words and images how so many of us feel about our 'kids'.

Over the next four or five years, she makes as many visits as she can, her trips funded, or so it seems, by a steady series of freelance journalism gigs, travel articles, perhaps.  Then she meets a man who looks like an Italian Peter Sellers.  I have one friend, Alice, who read this book thinking until shortly before the end that indeed it was Peter Sellers.<br /><br />But no, it is an Italian who falls in love with her.  Very romantic, except she speaks little Italian, despite her heritage and her culinary tastes.  He's handsome, goodlooking, dresses sharply, if conservatively as befits a banker, but with a hint of a repressed sexuality (she finds out that underneath his well-cut suits he wears underwear of purple silk.)  And this begins a strange romance, one which will make you weep a little as you remember your own first love, and which will also make you scratch your head a bit, worrying about our heroine and what will happen to her once the clouds of love and foodie-based endorphins dissipate. I sometimes wondered if Fernando isn't bipolar or something, he seems sort of moody, such as quitting his job once he latches on to the wonderful Marlena, or if he is taking advantage of her, like Isabel Archer when she married Gilbert Osmond in Henry James' THE WINGS OF THE DOVE which similarly is set in a dark, mysterious Venice, and features a bunch of characters like Madame Merle who certainly don't mean well for Isabel.<br /><br />I wonder if they are still married?  Alice says that her book club is now reading the sequel, in which Fernando and Marlena move abruptly to Tuscany, where UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN takes place, and that things continue to be puzzling between the lovers, but they are still together.  It just shows that perhaps, after all, what Grandma said is true, and that there's someone for everyone, and that love is made in Venice every night, as the old Burt Bacharach song used to tell us.  You will enjoy the scenes of Marlena shopping in the obscure botteghe of the canals, picking up lettuces and bringing them close to her face, like Mrs. Dalloway shopping for her party, but Italian style, ringed by harsh-voiced crones and old male peasants who bark out strange commands to her as she inspects their turnips and pasta.aps, after all, what Grandma said is true, and that there's someone for everyone, and that love is made in Venice every night, as the old Burt Bacharach song used to tell us.

Consider the following facts to cut through the spam. <br />In addition to being a foreign language major and having this course used in my college French class, I have done my own research and have the following comments to make: <br />1.  Behind the Wheel French is made by a foreign language teacher who was even rated as an EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR by French students at a major university.  Someone who has taught French at all levels including university, private school, community college, etc....  Now that's what I call A TEACHER. <br />2.  The professional voice on the CDs is that of a professional instructor in the French language. <br />3.  This course has and is used by a variety of educational institutions including universities because of its excellence.  <br />4.  Another spam claim is that there isn't enough time to repeat.  I have the opposite <br />opinion.  I feel I have TOO MUCH time to repeat.  I would personally have liked the course to go a little faster.    <br />This course has even been given the distinction of 'Great Value' by Men's Health Magazine when compared to industry leaders Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone. <br />Sorry teacher, but this one is the real winner.    <br />I feel sorry for that teacher is she doesn't know any more French than that. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />	2005-10-07

US	16224155	RWT32R464NFQU	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Amazing	I had to read this novel for my Advanced Placement English class. It was actually something which I loved. Incredible... Harper Lee's novel is a timeless telling of a battle with morality and ethics during the Depression. Major events include Scout and Jem's developments as human beings, with the senses of justice, morality, and self that are integral to the personal psyche; Tom Robinson's accusation, trial, and death, as well as experiences with and the aftermath of these events; and Bob Ewell's hell-bent campaign of revenge against discreditors, along with Atticus' eternally optimistic, comforting presence. <br />SCOUT <br />Scout Finch begins her journey in To Kill A Mockingbird as a naive, childish, innocent 5-year-old who is dependent upon those who surround her: Jem, Atticus, and others. When we leave her, she has become more mature, contemplative, and significantly independent in mental areas. Although she still needs Atticus and Jem, Scout's realization of injustice and her ability to \\"climb into [a person's] skin and walk around in it\\" (30) effectively fulfills the moral ambition which Harper Lee had set for the character. <br />JEM <br />Jeremy Finch begins the novel as much more mature than his younger sister. However, his journey is no less dramatic. Jem's major developments are in the areas of justice and morals. He was deeply immersed in the trial of Tom Robinson, whose verdict and human loss corrupted his new, inexperienced morals. Via Atticus and the good ol' time, the reader is confident that Jem's pysche will recover. <br />ATTICUS <br />Scout and Jem are highly dependent upon their father, who is the basis upon which they are able to morally and mentally develop. Atticus himself, as the foundation, is unwavering. He does not develop so much as details are revealed about him via circumstances that develop the others. If Bob Ewell is the Devil in the novel, Atticus is the always-good Christ figure. <br /> <br />LOSS OF INNOCENCE <br />The main theme, which is so deeply entwined in the novel that it is the source of the title, is the loss of innocence theme. In chapter 10, Atticus, the eternal voice of reason and conscience, tells Scout that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. This is reaffirmed on several occasions. The theme involves a \\"mockingbird,\\" or a completely innocent, uncorrupted person, being somehow damaged and hurt by an evil force that casuses them to lose their joy. Mockingbirds in the novel include Dill, Scout (who is able to maintain her optimism), and Jem (who is perhaps not so lucky), as well as Tom Robinson. However, the greatest example of all is that of Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, an energetic, enigmatic boy who was damaged psychologically by an abusive, neglectful father to the point of exile and withdrawal into himself. <br />RACISM <br />There are many who consider To Kill A Mockingbird's discussion of racism to be taboo and thus have challenged the book. However, the trial of Tom Robinson, an event so central to the novel, is governed by Depression-era Southern prejudice, which includes use of the N-word to provide authenticity. THe message of the book is one of denouncing racism, and is thus integral to the development of anti-prejudice beliefs in the reader's psyche, not to mention for Jem and Scout. <br />CRITIQUE OF ORTHODOX EDUCATION <br />Harper Lee shows her dislike for orthodox education in two main events. First, Miss Caroline's methods of teaching are shown to be ineffective and encourage Scout to not read until she's supposed to be able to. Atticus, who Lee has established as the voice of right, tells Scout to keep reading, which shows favor for individual development. The second event is the current events sequence, during which Lee claims the objectives of forced public speaking are useless. She is clearly in opposition to the apparent advantages of \\"being singled out [and made] more than ever anxious to return to the Group\\" (243) and the theory that the general populace is more important than one person. This may be part of the reason that To Kill A Mockingbird reflects the very individual developments of Scout and Jem. <br />OPTIMISM VS. PESSIMISM <br />The novel itself is littered with negative, pessimistic events. The greatest of these is undoubtedly racism, and the townspeople's collective inability to identify and deal with their own prejudice. Countering these events are such things as a three-hour jury deliberation and protection of life by an unexpected hero. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is certainly true of the novel: Boo Radley will kill them, Boo Radley saves their lives. Maycomb is racist, Scout and Jem are able to use that to develop their morals. However, there are no existences of Maycomb that are so completely different from each other than the existences of Bob Ewell and Atticus Finch. If Bob Ewell wears red horns, Atticus wears a halo, and it is his unceasing presence that comforts his children. Atticus protects justice, innocence, and goodness, and it is no coincidence that in the end it is Bob who is dead and Atticus who thrives. VERDICT: Optimism. <br />PERSONAL OPINION <br />It is quite rare that I enjoy examining and dissecting a novel when forced to. TO Kill A Mockingbird is one of those rare books. I enjoyed it as a novel, which has eternally been my main objective. I also very much liked reading into the various morals of the story and learning about the theories and philosophies that Lee had presented. <br />As a novel, I found it to be controversial, stimulating, educational and well-written. While I admire Atticus for his parenting, sense of justice, morality, disregard for absolute propriety, and optimism without naivete, I found his character to be flawed but a little too Christlike. The same applies to Bob Ewell: nobody is that entirely evil, and for Lee to portray him as such was unrealistic. All in all, though, it was an interesting read. <br /> <br />There has been much discussion about the use of the N-word, especially by people on this board, including one named D.Thill. While I understand the desire to protect young children from offensive language, perhaps parents such as this person should take into account the maturity it takes to read this novel and to comprehend the objectives behind the use of the word. It provides authenticity; for Lee to not include it would not be honoring her own artistic vision. It has nothing to do with a lack of vocabulary. Perhaps such an individual should review their own grammatical abilities and comprehension in order to then understand Lee's brilliance.  <br /> <br />The discussion over whether or not the morals of this novel are relevant nowadays ... it's dispicable. I am in an AP English class. Clearly, the Canadian AP board considers this novel to be important. Whether or not the Americans are too offended by a telling of their own sordid history remains to be seen. Not discredting Faulkner or other incredible authors, To Kill A Mockingbird deserves just as much.  <br />Children are not stupid; especially in a society such as today's, exposing them to a piece of classic literature that deals with the controversial events is perhaps the best thing that could be done. Perhaps people would rather children learn about these things from TV or movies, where the messages so clearly outlined in this novel may be distorted.	2005-10-07

It tries to flesh out something and bring something new to the table. It focuses on 2 main D&D races and introduces a 3rd. You get dwarves, gnomes and the new goliaths.<br /><br />While not a huge fan of dwarves or gnomes, it was nice to see a newly fleshed out race. The sections are formulaic, as most WOC books are. There sections on life, habitat, more gods for an already crowded pantheon. But face it, everybody in a pantheistic universe, is going to have their own god of something. However a little gem appears in there, a dwarven language section. It's only a page long, column style, with one work and its equivolent. Could be more, but I've learned to take what I can get.<br /><br />I did enjoy the section on the goliaths. I like them. It was a nice change from the established races, complete with the same sections as dwarves and gnomes. I just felt as it was new and not something we've read before it had a fresh perspective. It gives a goo frame work on how they work, live, play (include game mechanics for playing goatball) and move around as a good nomadic people do. The sample settlements helped me as I was able to have a nice village to stumble into for my game and a larger place down the way to send them to.<br /><br />Unfortunately the monster's section was too sparse. A lot more could've gone in there as most places of stone, are usually mountains. Although I found the dire eagles a nice toy to pair with a hill giant attack.<br /><br />There are sections on prestige classes as usual. I didn't find any to grab my interest, nothing I'd wanted to put a few levels of my regular classes off for. The magic items didn't interest me too much either I'm afraid. It happens.<br /><br />Overall, it's a useful book. If you can, borrow and use it, it'll probably be better that way.	2005-10-07

It surprisingly gets away from the common theme of war that has been monopolizing many trek shows, movies, and novels for the past few years. My main complaint about the book is the excessive amount of characters. They were not thoroughly described in this novel or the previous one. On more than one occasion, I was confused as to the identity of the character that I was reading. <br /> <br />As for the homosexual aspect of the book, I dont mind and neither should you.

In \\"Deed of Paksenarrion\\" there was very little explanation of the Girdish religion, so when I discovered this book I was very excited to learn more.  It was very disappointing, though.  Much of the plot didn't make sense to me (why, for example, is Luap so revered if Gird never even trusted him?), and it seemed like I was always waiting for character development to end and story to start.  Actually, the first part of the book detailing Gird's rise to power was fairly good.  The second part was the major disappointment.  I would suggest reading this book only if you are very curious about the characters, or if you can't not finish a series.  Deed of Paksenarrion is a much better read.	2005-10-07

Mike McElduff (and the Peggy's Spirit team), Sandra Jordan (and her husband) and Barbara Jo Kirshbaum are such angels-on-earth that it's hard not to feel inspired.  <br /> <br />There's a special kind of person who walks miles and miles, endures cold, wet, blisters and cramps, raises thousands of dollars and inspires others to listen and be educated about this disease that has torn so many families apart. We walk to raise awareness and inspire others to do the same. We walk for the survivors, for those we lost, for their families and for our future. We sacrifice one day, two days, three days, weeks, months, years, so that one day, we hope in our lifetimes, we will find a cure.  <br /> <br />I hope this continues to illustrate why we walk and why we will continue to dedicate our lives to the fight.	2005-10-07

Grant does often quote from primary sources, but not nearly to the extent that McCullough did. This should make the biography less challenging to readers that found the frequent shifts between McCullough's modern style and primary sources difficult. However, Grant makes the text less accessible by some use of vocabulary unfamiliar to the general audience.<br /><br />The book is worth reading because it gives a look at Adams using primary sources that have not been available previously just as the next Adams biography will do (the Massachusetts Historical Society has spent years compiling Adams' papers and has yet to complete the task). Grant goes out of his way to give a balanced look at John Adams. In some matters, he is highly supportive of Adams' efforts and methods, such as securing loans in The Netherlands. In others, Grant is highly critical of Adams such as his lack of tact as a diplomat. Granted, that particular opinion will not get much argument. One thing that is unusual for most recent biographies, Grant often discusses Adams' faith and religion, keeping its presense throughout the biography unlike, for example, Walter Stahr's biography of John Jay where his noted strong faith disappears for chapters at a time.<br /><br />As already mentioned, Grant's style does not lend itself to a general audience, at least one that does not wish to have a dictionary handy. Grant brings a highly analytical style, which makes this biography more than a simple narration of Adams' life. The danger with this is that the objectivity can be lost in favor of only citing sources that support a particular point of view. Grant slips into this commentary several times, which could be a distraction if one does not enjoys this style of biography. The stylistic issues raised in the preceding can be considered positives or negatives depending on the reader's own personal preference.<br /><br />In this reviewer's opinion, this biography of John Adams will not appeal to everyone. It will be heartily enjoyed by some for its analytical and direct style, but may be a disappointment to others who are looking for a milder approach. However, this reviewer endorses an attempt at reading this biography because of the quantity and perhaps quality of what it has to offer.e reader's own personal preference. <br /> <br />In this reviewer's opinion, this biography of John Adams will not appeal to everyone.

This American History book is a very good, but not excellent  coverage of the History of the United States. The book is  typical entry level college material. Historical information is either very interesting with good detail to boring and vague.  Photographs, portraits, paintings, charts, and illustrations are abundant and beautiful helping to keep interest level moving.  However, the book rapidly sheds its allure and interest. That is because it fails to deliver on providing enough, interesting and neccessary political and war detail maps associated with important major historical events.<br /><br />A history book with only a few maps in my opinion can not be recommended.  Maps provide important visual political and geographical illustrative information that words alone can not. Previous editions of this textbook included enough maps to statisfy the reader. And the maps are still available, but the reader has to enroll, for additional cost, into an internet online service called \\" [...]\\" to access the maps.  The textbook is already way overpriced at $96.00 dollars. The textbook is a beautiful hardcover with over 900 pages, but most of the information was compliled 40 years ago with frequent updating editions to the present year. no wonder this adds to why the cost of college education is soaring.<br /><br />The authors receive commendation for a generally well organized book covering over 400 years of complex historical information. However, as historians they sold out on the students of history by not supplying all the information needed (the maps!).<br /><br />Even so this history textbook is one of the better ones available. However, if maps are important to you.  You will be disappointed.	2005-10-07

Unfortunately, it doesn't cover the 2500/3500 series trucks in any depth and doesn't cover the diesel engine systems at all.  It has a considerable number of subjects where it tells you that the subject is too complex for the home garage mechanic and advises you to go to the dealer or repair shop for service.  It would have been better if it had gone into more detail in these particular subject areas so you could deal better with your maintenance facility as an intelligent/informed customer.  Nonetheless, it does provide the information to be able to perform much of what would be expensive service in your own driveway.  A good reference but should have been titled for the 1500 gas powered series Sierra and Silverado.	2005-10-07

He travels through some of the most forbidding locales in some of the world's poorest countries; and he travels alone, without a cell phone or internet connection, and without a plan.<br /><br />Along the way he makes many literary references, mostly to Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which he reads over and over again.  There are also some entertaining encounters with Nobel laureates, Naguib Mafouz at the beginning of his journey and Nadine Gordimer at the end.<br /><br />Theroux describes the poverty and depravation of what he sees, which he claims is worse now than it was 40 years ago when he was a Peace Corps volunteer.  Over the past 40 years, Africa has undergone urbanization just like the rest of the world.  Today about 75% of Africa's population live in urban areas, many in squatter settlements on the outskirts of cities.  Theroux writes: \\"Even at their best, African cities seemed to me miserable impoverished anthills, attracting the poor and desparate from the bush and turning them into theives and devisers of cruel scams.\\"<br /><br />As people leave the villages, the civil society of the tribal life disappears altogether.  And since there are no jobs in the city, scamming and theivery become the only means of survival.  The only thing standing in their way are the local police, who Theroux claims are no more than \\"licensed theives\\" themselves.<br /><br />Theroux has some very uncharitable opinions about much of what he sees in Africa, many other writers have described these conditions as well.  However, he unleashes most of his vitriol at the foreign aid workers.  He refers to them as \\"in general oafish self-dramatizing pigs, and often complete bastards.\\"<br /><br />It is not off the mark to criticize the foreign aid bureaucracy as it exits today in Africa.  It is true that aid corrupts both donors and recipients.  Aid programs have turned African problems into permanent conditions.  If the streets were lined with beggars before, the beggars now expect such aid with a sense of entitlement.  I think, however, that Theroux goes overboard in attributing most of Africa's problems to foreign aid, especially when he writes that the sharpest lesson foreign aid workers could teach is to turn their backs and go home.<br /><br />Abandoning Africa as Theroux suggests is not the answer.  A more hopeful, but controversial, approach is outlined in Jeffrey Sach's \\"The End of Poverty.\\"  Africa will need more aid in the future, not less.  Africa needs economic development so that they can reach \\"the first rung of the economic ladder.\\"  This means going beyond the subsistence level of the village, which Theroux romanticizes, and producing goods for export which will allow them to participate in the current wave of globalization.  Only when they reach this level of development should anyone speak realistically about reducing foreign aid.<br /><br />The way aid is currently administered it constitutes a large portion of revenue for many African governments.  And when governments get their revenues from abroad, and do not draw their revenues from the commerce and industry of their citizens, they usually take little interest in their citizens.  The result is always corrupt a government and an impoverish citizenry.  Many of the Arab countries in the Middle East that derive most of their revenue from oil are facing similar problems.<br /><br />Although it is true that aid has not accomplished much in Africa in the last 40 years, it would be a tragedy to withdraw it at this point.  Aid must be administered in a way that would enable Africans to participate in the global economy rather than being its victims.  This is no small task, outsiders have thus far been unable to change things no matter how good their intentions.  Even with aid, Theroux is correct when he says that only Africans are capable of making a difference in Africa.	2005-10-07

It seems that every day we learn of someone close to us being diagnosed and all too often their cancer is terminal.  There is nothing that can prepare us for a terminal diagnosis and the grief we experience at these times is intensified by our fear of the unknown, and our lack of knowledge regarding the disease and the pain and symptoms associated with it.      From personal experience I know that knowledge is the key to providing a better \\"quality of life\\" for the cancer patient.  Better understanding of the stages of the disease and of methods and medications available to treat the pain and symptoms caused by it, allow for the patient and those who care for them, to make informed decisions regarding their care.  In this way, they are able to regain some control over their lives.     Rarely does one find all the information they need in one book, however I believe Howard's well researched and comprehensive book \\"Lung Cancer & Mesothelioma\\", is quite unique. It provides a wealth of relevant and useful information including; how various types of cancer are formed, medical trials, available treatments and medications, insight and discussion regarding the emotional burden of cancer upon the patient and their families and ways by which to manage grief.      I believe this book will provide an invaluable resource for anyone who has or who is caring for someone with cancer.

My first impression of this book was that it was a must read for those who don't care if they upset the status quo as they search for Truth.  I gave it 4 'stars'.  I originally thought, Yes, it is hard to look past the traditional ways things are taught, but always well worth it when it takes one deeper in faith built on truth.  Although I still hold to this view, I cannot in good faith recommend this book to be such a read. This book takes one beyond the 'din of tradition' and into the screams of New-age thought.  I really don't recommend it.  Even well grounded Christians can buy into it.  I held any true faith in this book for awhile, until I also read LET THERE BE LIGHT.  This book,BIblical Dyslexia, really made me think and forced me to go back and really study it alongside my Bible, Concordance, Jewish History and Lexicons! Doing this did not really give me an indication of whether it is true or not.  Only when I delved into more books like it (Let there be light by Rocco Errico, and the Bible translation by Dr. George Lamsa, did I finally see it for it is.   After reading LET THERE BE LIGHT, I no longer feel Biblical Dyslexia is based on the truth of the Bible.  Let there be true light in the hearts of men, and the 'angle of light' be exposed for what it really is.  Division and confusion. I now would give it 1 star because it at least caused me to grow in what I really believe.	2005-10-07

Fuggedaboutit!  On the House will indeed keep you up all night and have you in tears - of laughter.  Even years of reading dumb criminal anecdotes couldn't prepare me for this book.  The persistence of both the crooks and their erstwhile victim should have made it into the Guiness Book of World Records.  So should Simon Read for keeping his face straight long enough to bring this bizarre story to print. <br /> <br />On the House covers the exploits of a gang of lowlifes dubbed The Murder Trust as they try to pull off a simple murder-for-insurance scheme.  They had it all planned: the insurance, the murder method, and the victim.  Unfortunately, they chose a victim with more lives than a Hindu cat.  The holding power of this book is not the brutality of the crime or the sympathetic qualities of the victim: it's the horrified fascination as we watch this witless bunch of crooks verge on nervous breakdowns as their every attempt is met with abject failure.  Their victim takes everything they serve up and keeps coming back for more. <br /> <br />Honestly, I started getting just as desperate.  Read does an expert job of putting us in these feeble criminals' minds.  He shows why each attempt should have worked, so we share the crooks' disbelief as the victim survives - not once, not twice, but dozens of times. <br /> <br />I've never read a true crime book like it.  Neither have you.  So if you're ready to set aside the serial killers and the Mobsters and read about Keystone Kriminals instead, pick up this book.  And then raise a glass in honor of Mike \\"Iron Man\\" Malloy.	2005-10-07

Boose, Jr. provides an authoritative survey of the composition and doctrine of the US Army in the Korean War in Osprey's Battle Orders #11. Readers looking for detailed line and block charts of various US Army units in this period, as well as details on tables of organization and equipment, will be well satisfied with this volume. However, readers should note that the omission of US Marine, UN and ROK units (which were often attached to US units) renders this account a partial one.<br /><br /> US Army Forces in the Korean War 1950-53 begins with introductory sections on the mission of US Army units in Korea, doctrine and training. In these sections, the author notes the gradual desegregation of the US Army in 1950-51 and the introduction of KATUSA augmentees. The heart of the volume lies in the 23-page section on unit organization, which details US units from 8th Army down to battalion level. Although Boose admits that he focuses on combat units at the expense of support units, some omissions probably required greater clarification. For example, Boose notes the Regimental Tank Company owned two medium trucks for mess and supply, but this clearly did not encompass fuel and ammunition resupply. This is no small issue. Even thirty years later, when my tank platoon in the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea was attached to an infantry unit, we had major problems getting fuel and ammunition since the infantry supply structure was not configured to support our requirements.<br /><br /> This volume has eight 2-D maps: the Korean War. Phase 1 (delay and defense); Phase II (counteroffensive); Phase III (war of movement); Phase IV (static warfare); UN offensive operations, September-October 1950; 8th Army advances north, 1951; corps boundary shift, April 1952; Korea communications zone, 1952-53. The author also includes numerous line and block charts on units from army to battalion level. Other sections cover weapons, C3I and unit status (a thumb-nail history of all major units in Korea). There is a wealth of information in these pages.<br /><br /> Although this volume is not designed to address the operational aspects of the war in much detail, I did have the sense that the author was soft-peddling the multitude of US setbacks in the war. The virtual destruction of the 24th Infantry Division in July-August 1950 (including the capture of its commander) get virtually no mention here. The 2nd Infantry Division's defeat in November 1950 - one of the greatest one-day losses in US military history - appears as a \\"setback.\\" Further US defeats in early 1951 also are barely mentioned. Boose tends to ascribe early US problems to understrength units but there was a lot more to it than that, including poor air-ground cooperation at the start, unrealistic training and a condescending attitude toward the KPA (a mistake the US repeated by underestimating the Chinese troops). The fact is that the US Army was initially unprepared for a tough ground war in Korea and was often outmaneuvered and outfought in the early months of the war. Boose also tends to repeat inaccurate shibboleths, such as \\"movement was restricted to roads and streambeds.\\" Although often described as \\"poor tank country\\" by non-armor officers, the fact is that armor can go just about anywhere in Korea, if the crews are daring enough. When I served as an armor officer in Korea, our tanks - which were much larger than the Korean War-vintage models - could go up some very steep slopes and through very narrow defiles (sometimes scraping rock on both sides). At any rate, Colonel Boose's volume is an excellent reference on the US Army in the Korean War, but its incompleteness suggests that it would best be used as an adjunct to other, more complete sources, such as Clay Blair's excellent history of the war.thumb-nail history of all major units in Korea).

I compare this novel to \\"The Rule of Four\\" and \\"Gods of Aberdeen,\\" both recent reads. The difference between the two is the amount of research and resulting comfort with the subject matter with which Miss Kostova writes this novel. <br /> <br />In all three books, the authors attempt to impress with their vocabulary, but fall short. As I read \\"The Historian,\\" I had to wince at some of her word choices. I am a firm subscriber to Strunk & White's rules of simplicity: \\"Say what you mean, mean what you say, and do so simply.\\" While this is not Kostova's strong suit, her grasp of the Vlad Tepes/Dracula legend is phenomenal. <br /> <br />This alone gripped me. If you are interested in learning about the historical basis for the legend, I highly advise picking up this novel.

It is noteworthy he shies away from including Judaism in his list of religions that are anathema.  This compromises his integrity in the name of political correctness.<br /> Nowhere does he account for the ultimate basis of morality and the legitimacy of judging one act as right and another as wrong.<br /> He attacks the design argument by a cursory assumption of the veracity of Darwinism.<br /> He ignores the fact of human sin and whether or not there is a solution for it and whether or not sin incurs judgment on the other side of the grave.<br /> He ignores the supernatural history and continuity of Christian revelation and its consummation in the Life, Death and Resurrection of Christ.<br /> He criticizes Christ's character on the basis of the latter's pronouncements on sin, death, judgment and hell.  If hell is real, Christ's adamant emotions on the subject are well warranted.  But, Russell simply presumes against these teachings.  He doesn't accomplish what he wishes by begging the question.  By His resurrection, Christ is in a better position to decide the question concerning the existence of hell.<br /> Unfortunately, great achievements in mathematical logic have proven, with Russell, that they are insufficient credentials for making a good theologian or a cogent apologist for the ungodly.<br /> Russell, like John Stuart Mill or Charles Darwin, possessed an impressive mind.  He was erudite in his professional career and a lucid and eloquent writer.  But he was stillborn in his criticism of Christianity.<br /> I think a pervasive Darwinist culture put the blinders on so that his horse could not take his carriage down the right path.  Had he been exposed to modern results of Creationist researchers, his Darwinism would have fallen apart and the rest of his criticisms with it.<br /> Fossilization has proven the catastrophic model of the biblical flood as against the uniformatarianism of Darwinism.  Unfossilized dinosaur bones, including their fresh blood, has refuted the speculations and circular reasoning of the great ages of the dinosaurs posited arbitrarily by evolutionists.  Paleontologist Mary Schweitzer's and others have verified this.  Folklore, linguistics and artwork across the globe testify to the flood, the coexistence of dinosaurs (aka dragons) with man and such biblical narrations as the tower of Babel.  Submerged civilizations such as off the coast of Cuba, Yamaguchi Japan, Lake Titicaca and so on confirms not only biblical accounts but a different geography and atmosphere of earth's past.<br /> Russell reckons the universe too unjust for God to exist.  But, he puts the cart before the horse.  It would be more unjust for there to be no God to punish the wicked who have perpetrated so much harm to other people.  And we know their number is plenty and their crimes horrific.  Even the notion of law has no meaning unless there is a lawgiver.  As a logician, familiar with the notions of sense and reference, Russell should know this .  The primitive Aristotelian logic of the Scholastics he criticizes didn't blind the scholastics to this fact, but Russell missed the point.<br /> The sophistries of the devil and human sin have proved more than a match for the intellectual acumen of Bertrand Russell.  Ironically, in his last days he embraced the Sermon on the Mount as a model of morality.	2005-10-07

I would classify it as fantasy/alternative history with a large dollop of terror thrown in. <br />  <br />THE PRIEST OF BLOOD follows Aleric, a peasant boy in medieval France, who lives at the edge of a great forest filled with practitioners of an ancient religion, among other mysteries. <br /> <br />Aleric's existence is a harsh one-he lives in the most abject poverty with his siblings, his father has disappeared and his mother is the village whore. The only positive influence in Aleric's life is the presence of his grandfather, an old soldier who teaches the boy how to train birds and who shares with him tales of the Old Ways. <br /> <br />Aleric's talent with birds-particularly falcons-leads him to a position within the castle of the local Baron. There, Aleric becomes known as Falconer and falls in love with the Baron's daughter. That relationship-forbidden on many levels-leads to Falconer's conscription into military service as a soldier in a Crusade to the Holy Land, where his life will end and his afterlife will begin. <br /> <br />THE PRIEST OF BLOOD is the first volume in a series called THE VAMPYRICON, so it's no surprise what sort of creature Aleric becomes. What is noteworthy is how Clegg melds historical detail with the very human story of Aleric. In fact, the first half of THE PRIEST OF BLOOD is nearly devoid of supernatural elements, yet may be the most gripping writing Clegg has ever produced. <br /> <br />Cleggs opens the door to a number of interesting concepts here, including the nature of Vampyrism, which is different enough from the variations that have come before to keep it interesting. The inexorable march of Christianity across Europe is another theme Clegg explores, as we watch the old religions and their followers trampled under the onslaught of the one God. <br /> <br />THE PRIEST OF BLOOD ends on something of a cliffhanger, one which will make most readers anxious for the sequel. Grab itif you can, and join Clegg on the ground floor of what looks to be his most remarkable work yet.	2005-10-07

Douglas Thayer is a gifted writer and knows how to portray Mormon thought and action by boys just reaching maturity and contemplating missionary service in the church. I was once such a maturing LDS boy myself and was reminded of that fact as I read about Jeff and his cousin. In reading this book I greatly appreciated being able to relive what went through my own mind as I was striving for a testimony in getting ready for going on a mission. <br /> <br />But there is one aspect of what I went through in growing up that does not play a part in the story of Jeff and Christopher. I would have liked to have seen such a gifted author as Thayer handle it, since it was a big factor in my own handling of it. I refer to my effort to get an orthodox Mormon testimony. While Jeff's thoughts can be described as centering on girls and cars, mine had more to do with testimony. <br /> <br />I was growing up during the 1930s depression and for some reason did not worry very much either about cars or girls. In fact I never owned a car until several years after fulfill-ing my mission. Nor did I marry my wife for a couple of years after returning home from my mission. I cannot recall ever kissing a girl before dating my wife and the car came af-ter that. <br /> <br />But I did have problems while preparing for my mission. I wanted an orthodox testimony and could not get one. In fact I started praying about obtaining such a testimony (using Moroni 10:1-3 and James 1: 5-6, 2:17) shortly after being baptized at the age of eight. I read the Book of Mormon as Jeff and Christopher did. But I saw in it much that made me question its historicity. <br /> <br />For example in 2 Nephi 2:22, Lehi tells us in words as plain as can possibly be written that before Adam's transgression in the Garden of Eden nothing had died in this world - neither plants nor animals had tasted of death. Our scriptures date the transgression at about 6000 year ago. Ihad to ask myself, \\"How can this possibly be true? Where did all the fossils come from? What produced coal and how come the extinct dinosaurs disap-peared if no living thing could possibly die?\\" <br /> <br />The Book of Mormon and the other Standard Works have many scriptures equally difficult to believe as being literally true. I wanted to go on a mission and did indeed do so, but not with an orthodox testimony. I came to question the historicity of many of our Standard Works and could not tell our investigators that these works were historical. <br /> <br />I would have liked to see how Douglas Thayer could have treated the type of problem that I had as a maturing LDS boy preparing to go on a mission, but not being able to develop an orthodox testimony.      <br /> <br />My name is Glen Wade (Santa Barbara, CA) <br />	2005-10-07

This National Book Award winner and treasure trove contain all 41 of Eudora Welty's short stories, including: \\"A Curtain of Green and Other Stories,\\" (1941); \\"The Wide Net and Other Stories ,\\"(1943); the seven interlocking narratives of \\"The Golden Apples,\\" (1949), \\"The Bride of the Innisfallen and Other Stories,\\" 1955, as well as two previously uncollected works, \\"Where Is the Voice Coming From?\\" (1963), and \\"The Demonstrators\\" (1966). Miss Welty also wrote a Preface especially for this edition, in which she says: \\"I have been told, both in approval and in accusation, that I seem to love all my characters. What I do in writing of any character is to try to enter into the mind, heart and skin of a human being who is not myself.\\"<br /><br />The intricacies of human relationships is the primary theme in this collection of short fiction. Eudora Welty's works combine wonderful humor and an astute perception of human psychology. Her ear for dialogue is superb and her prose lyrical and nuanced.<br /><br />Eudora Welty was born in Jackson, Mississippi where she spent most of her life. From the moment of publication, her collections of stories won wide critical acclaim, as did her novels, \\"The Robber Bridegroom,\\" \\"Delta Wedding,\\" \\"The Ponder Heart,\\" \\"Losing Battles,\\" and \\"The Optimist's Daughter,\\" which won the 1973 Pulitzer Prize. Her autobiography, One Writer's Beginnings, won both the American Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1984. In 1996, Welty was given France's highest civilian honor, the French Legion of Honor Award.<br /><br />This is a remarkable compilation of short fiction by one of the most gifted writers of our time. This volume enriches any library it graces. Highly recommended.<br /><br />JANA	2005-10-07

Along with his co-author, he makes current edge economic research accessible to the masses. This is no small feat when you look at the insano math behinds much of economics nowadays.  <br /> <br />Some of the items he addresses are:  <br />- What really lowers crime? (Prisons - yes. Cops - yes. Innovative strategies - no. Abortion - yes.)  <br />- Why do drug dealers live with their parents? (They're poor)  <br />- How much impact do parents have on their kids? (A lot from the genetic point of view, but their peers have more impact afterwards)  <br />- Does school choice improve things? (For technical schools yet, but the act of wanting to change schools is the determining factor, not whether or not the change actually happens)  <br /> <br />What's interesting here, is much of this flies in the face of conventional or current wisdom.  <br />- The idea that Mayor G.'s \\"fix the broken windows\\" theory of policing was not the cause of lowering crime contradicts the writing of Malcolm Gladwell, who still writes raves reviews of Freakonomics.  <br />- The idea that one's name signals parental economics preferences, but doesn't impact the child contradicts other University of Chicago research.  <br /> <br />While the results are counter-intuitive, Levitt clearly explains the rationale behind his arguements. While you are exposed to his lateral thinking, the one thing you won't get is the complicated math used behind the scenes. For that you'll have to find the original papers quoted in his notes section at the end.  <br /> <br />It's an easy read, and it's about time Economics got a Carl Sagan.	2005-10-07

Both the ozone hole of 15 years ago and more recent differences about the human contribution to global warming are examples. What is frightening, however, are efforts to undermine the nature of science itself and the criteria by which scientists reach their conclusions. To me, this is the scariest part of Cris Mooney's excellent book. He has done a service by bringing together under one cover the familiar stories about industry and government efforts to suppress or ignore scientific input on topics ranging from tobacco smoke to missile defense to global warming. But even more valuable, and less familiar, is Money's expose of recent efforts to alter the way science works and the standards of evidence it accepts. Those who wish to protect the integrity of science need to become sensitive to the pernicious re-definitions being imposed on such terms as \\"sound science\\", \\"data quality\\", and \\"peer review\\". (Unfortunately, Washington Post reviewer Keay Davidson appears to have missed some important subtleties in these areas, namely that these terms as used by the current Administration have lost their original meanings.) This is an important book, of interest to anyone who is concerned about the future of science in America.	2005-10-07

In my opinion this book looks at this topic from an American perspective and what America needs to do to remain competitive globally as well as to recognize Asia as an opportunity for partnering for growth. <br /> <br />Firstly the book lists the historical outline of global economics in a very clear and crisp summary under each chapter. I was amazed by the clarity and depth of the author's understanding of India's transformational journey from a controlled economy into a vibrant market economy in the 90's.  \\"Made in China\\" and \\"Serviced in  India\\" are two chapters that one should not miss in this book. <br /> <br />Secondly the description of the economies on either sides of the Atlantic - America to spend and consume while Western Europe to save and produce - is amazing. The author claims that Europeans were taxed on their consumption while Americans were taxed on their income with incentives for consumption is what has caused the world's biggest economy to end up as the world's biggest debtor. <br /> <br />With Asia, China and India in particular emerging as global economies very fast, the EU, NAFTA and perhaps an Asian Union with an Asian currency appears to become a reality soon. <br /> <br />The book also focuses on the weakening dollar and the global impact of rising oil prices. America is advised to tighten its belt, reduce consumption and conserve energy while from a strategic level should quickly put in place a plan for global competitiveness. <br /> <br />The author strongly defends manufacturing as a core economic activity and America's neglect of this sector is a main reason for losing its competitive edge in research and technical education. <br /> <br />Oil has risen from 30's to 60's since this book was in print. If the author should publish a revised edition of the book , he would further reinforce his views and forecasts of the first edition. <br /> <br />The bottom line is clear. Three billion new capitalists from the east have begun their economic march. Do not ignore them or fight them, but join them to make this planet a better place for all mankind in the twenty-first century.	2005-10-06

Paton states in his introduction, 'Kant's \\"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\\" is one of the small books which are truly great' despite the unapproachability of the title.  Many rank this book alongside Aristotle's 'Ethics' and Plato's 'Republic'.  Its main topic is the supremacy of morals and moral action, and Paton gives a section by section analysis of Kant's book.  The purpose of this work is not to work out all of the implications and difficulties with the a priori part of ethics, but rather to set a foundation of the supreme principle of morality.<br /><br />The centerpiece of the Groundwork is Kant's most famous proposition, the Categorical Imperative.  While this is often equated with the Golden Rule (do unto others as you would have them do unto you), the Categorical Imperative argues for a more universal set of moral action - for example, if one does not mind being lied to, then lying does not become a problem, according to the Golden Rule, but for Kant, this would be unacceptable as it is a violation of the rational principles of what morals are.<br /><br />Kant proceeds to look at issues of law, duty, free will and the good will, and autonomy of action.  Kant argues strongly for the need for philosophy to guard against whim, taste and personal desire from becoming normative agents in the way we construct the moral universe.  He argue for objective principles to govern the will, and categorises these as either hypothetical or categorical.  'All imperatives command either hypothetically or categorically.  Hypothetical imperatives declare a possible action to be practically necessary as a means to the attainment of something else that one wills (or that one may will).  A categorical imperative would be one which represented an action as objectively necessary in itself apart from its relation to a further end.'<br /><br />Kant goes from this discussion to the formulation of universal law and the way in which rational agents should formulate and view this kind of law.  The final section of this work introduces ideas that will be more fully developed in Kant's 'Critique of Practical Reason', the second of his three-volume Critiques.  He also covers some of the arguments from 'Critique of Pure Reason', but not very fully; as Paton states in his analysis, 'Kant cannot assume the elaborate arguments of the \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\" to be familiar to his readers nor can he attempt to repeat these elaborate arguments in a short treatise on ethics.'  The finite, rational person must regard himself or herself both as a member of the world of experience/perception and also as a member of the world of ideas/rationality.  This is the essence of the Empiricist/Rationalist split that Kant synthesises together in the first Critique.<br /><br />This is not easy going - the original 'Groundwork' had 128 pages, contained here in less than 100 (allowing for type-face differences as well as translation).  Paton's version has 40 pages of analysis, endnotes, an index, and a statement about the translation - it is the 40 pages of analysis, keyed to section-by-section sequence, that makes this a very useful edition.  This is perhaps the best first text of Kant to read to get a sense of his style, thought, and the foundation of what has become known as his most important principle.hould formulate and view this kind of law.

I loved it - right from the title \\"Born to Kvetch\\" I laughed through the whole of it.  <br /> <br />How wonderful to learn such a lot with such good humour.

Hummmmm...I say Hawkins calibrations are measurements from his own life filter, from his own perspective and are a reflection of his own self-expression and the life he has lived. <br /> <br />Let's say you use the muscle testing technique to test the level of truth of the furniture in your house. Your sofa calibrates at 220 and your dining room chair at 300. What exactly does it mean that one chair has a higher level of truth than another? The relevant question however is, now that you have this information, what are you going to do next?  Have you been able to successfully use muscle testing yourself to prove or disprove this theory or the assessments he has made about people, places, things, times and events? <br /> <br />Hawkins states \\"research indicated that truth is actually available relative to an absolute constant. Its degree of validity is identifiable on a calibratable scale that includes all of life in all of its expressions throughout history.\\"  He then confuses the matter by taking his \\"truth\\" measurements and putting them into what he calls a consciousness table. He then states that his calibrations measure the level of consciousness of the stuff he tests. Hawkins work as it is presented is just another book like all those other holy books that people claim to be the one true Truth. Book in hand, they then go out and justify their actions, judge and condemn others, all with the greatest air of superiority because, after all, they calibrate at a higher level of consciousness then you. And of course a book backs you where the author has calibrated the level of truth of his own chapters.  <br /> <br />There is a wonderful email being passed around the internet right now, of a speech Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple Computer, gave to the graduating class of Stanford University. He tells the story of being fired from Apple Computer, a company he himself started and how at the time it was the worst thing that had ever happened to him in his life. Now years later he sees how it was one the best things that ever that ever happened to him. Many of us have had life experience where our truth about something changed as we changed. That is, it's all a matter of perspective. The only absolute constant is change. Is it true as Hawkins suggests that Mickey Mouse calibrates at 205 forever? <br /> <br />Current wisdom teachings say that true vs. false is a construct that we make up given what we are trying to do. In this model the constant is the intention you have set for the situation. It is a continuous scale as opposed to some absolute constant. <br /> <br />Hawkins put a lot of time and work into his philosophy and I'm sure has had a great time doing it. It all sounds so logical, coming form our other God we call science. I myself have been thoughly entertained by it all. His consciousness table aside, some of his other points can be correlated with other wisdom and spiritual teachings. However, the great wisdom teachings of our time say that the highest truth you can know for yourself is the truth you find within. Let your own soul be your guide. So if you can successfully use muscle testing and access the level of truth for your own life situations then do it. Then go do whatever you do when you know the truth. But don't use Hawkins measurements as your guide, go to the Source yourself. I don't doubt that things can be measured and are measurable. Hawkins books have got me thinking about what exactly do we mean by the word truth anyway. The work of Byron Katie has an interesting perspective on that. But I don't know where the idea of an \\"absolute constant\\" (the foundation of his theory) fits into an ever expanding universe of infinite possibility. It still begs the question, now that we know a truth, what's our next move?  And so the conversation continues. <br /> <br />If you are looking toward your own enlightenment development or creating a better world, Jerry and Esther Hicks offers an interesting book along the lines of putting things on a scale. Its called Ask and It Is Given. This book does not have any of the judgments assessments and evaluations the Hawkins book has. <br />	2005-10-06

There's also Colonel Blood, a ne'er do well and a cad who nevertheless is on the side of good (most of the time, whether he wants to be or not) to provide the grit for the story.And hilarious anachronism's (Sheba's boots by Gucci. for instance) and a cast of despicable pirates, plus the loathsome villain Don Lardo.

These are words I have longed to hear: \\"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, I have all the previous collections, in their various iterations, but when that big hardcover \\"Complete Far Side\\" came out a few years ago, THIS was the one strip I had hoped somebody would compile. And here it is. <br /> <br />I can't imagine anyone reading this far in this review who would have no exposure to this tyke and his tiger, but if you are in this small, lamentable cohort, you are among the luckiest people on Earth. You get to discover all this, all at once, much to your delight. <br /> <br />The only real precursor to C&H is \\"Peanuts\\" (also being lovingly collected in beautiful hardcovers), with the deceptively simple lines and boundless imagination. However, in direct contradistinction to that strip, Calvin has never been fully merchandised. Everything that is \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\" is right here. It's a world that had a beginning and an end. It is self-contained. <br /> <br />And...it's funnier. <br /> <br />What you get here is three large, exquisitely detailed tomes filled with the most hilarious, hysterical, touching and surprising stories you'll ever read.  <br /> <br />Prose, poetry, film, comic books...just like those media, these are also complete stories. Some are told in three panels, some across weeks. Some are told magically in a single wordless panel. Wit, pathos, drama, suspense...even science fiction...all here, and all woven effortlessly and seamlessly together by Bill Watterson. <br /> <br />The construction of the book itself is something to behold. The binding is hefty, the paper thick and lustrous. The color reproductions are gorgeous. All contained in an illustrated slipcase. <br /> <br />I can't say enough about the strip itself. I don't think I've ever laughed harder at anything in my life. I've seen funny movies, heard comedians give killer lines during stand-up...but the convulsive, explosive laughter that this little guy generates is, I believe, unique. <br /> <br />This is something a lot of people will treasure for the rest of their lives. You will want your kids to read this. And their kids. <br /> <br />Now they'll be able to!	2005-10-06

There is an interesting contrast between Bobby and a girl who is blind, and the relationship that develops between two people who see themselves as damaged, one who cannot be seen, and like every teenager feels his parents are out to run his life, and one who people choose to look away from. <br /> <br />I did find it slightly creepy that Bobby wanders around naked with Alicia, and gets close to her physically.  Just because she can't see him and nobody else can doesn't make it less creepy.  I almost wish he'd gotten to wear invisible boxers, but they wouldn't work for plot reasons.  I kept expecting it to bother Bobby more, too: hello, he is a teenage boy!  So that part didn't quite ring true. <br /> <br />Despite its flaws, this is a book worth reading.	2005-10-06

He's set the reader up for another series of mysteries, this time with an Scottish heroine, and frankly, I'm disappointed.<br /><br />Isabel, our hero in this mystery, is nothing more than a nosy neighbor with an active imagination.  Heck, this lady creates drama were ever she goes.  Half her theories are outlandish and completely wrong.  She is completely missing the folkish charm of McCall Smith's first mystery heroine.  She's also tediously concerned with manners, agonizing over every interaction to the point of boring the reader to death.<br /><br />The strong point of this novel was Isabel's applied ethical dilemmas, which were tangential to the story.  I enjoyed reading about the morality of being overweight, the place of gene-testing in marital infidelity, the ethics of gambling, and the relevance of telling the absolute \\"truth\\" in amorous relationships, among other topics.  When Isabel switched from applied ethics to agonizing over manners and morality in her own life, the story really started to drag.<br /><br />Overall, there was truly no action in this book.  The mystery was resolved on a very subtle note.  The highest point of drama was the interpersonal relationship between Isabel and her niece Cat.  I'm left not wanting to read any more about Isabel Dalhousie.	2005-10-06

The premise is a really interesting one.  In 1946 San Francisco an amoral WWII vet stumbles upon a portal to an alternate world where technology is stuck in the bronze ages and America remains undiscovered by the wider world.  Rounding up some of his army buddies (and eventually some Nazis, Franco-Algerians, Rhodesian whites, Communist hard liners and other assorted no good types who can't bear to live in our world)and set out to found a new society where they can be top dogs.  Stirling has shown before with books like Drakas, the Nantucket Trilogy, and Peshawar Lancers, that he can create really interesting and engaging premises and that he spends a lot of time planning out his worlds.  Conquistador is no different and it's interesting to see the world that the antagonists create.  There's also a fairly interesting mystery at the heart of the first half of the book when a couple of fish and wildlife cops begin to get wise to what is going on.  That said, there are some pacing problems and there are many of the same old Steve Stirling hobby horses that get annoyingly trotted out.  Characters are far too competent for example.  What annoyed me more however is how Stirlings pet themes and his bad sociology impacted the portrayal of this alternate world.  The set up for the alternate world makes it clear that these folks should be evil.  The addition over time of a lot of other guys such as Nazi and Communist hardliners (oh and TPTB don't import minorities in order to reduce friction but they'll mix Nazis with Communists?) and white African colonists should make them a pretty unsavory bunch by our standards.  These are guys who, from the founder to the more recent immigrants, have a strong experience of hierarchical rule and elite power, a fact which is reflected in the tiered citizenship of their society.  Yet in Stirlings world the people are mostly happy and content and the alternate world almost comes across as an ecotoruist utopia of good land management and good living (why a 1946 WWII vet who founded the society explicitly to exploit its natural resources would become a hard core environmentalist is never quite explained).  The extermination of the natives is glossed over and treated as an act of the few bad eggs in society (again why an amoral 1946 vet would feel any compunction against sluaghtering the Indians is unexplained) and the clientage of the Indians (another theme of Stirlings work) is treated as a mutually recognized beneficial system.  THere are also some characterization problems.  THe main character is treated as a pretty upright guy, although one who doesn't always follow the rule book.  Yet when a woman from the company he is investigating auspiciously comes forward and asks to work with him he not only lets her but becomes romantically involved, and even after he learns that she is involved in some sort of shady dealings he seriously believes he can continue the relationship.	2005-10-06

The carpet added just the bit of class to go along with the beautiful sunsets over the Sunsphere to inspire my return home, the second time.  I moved it to an apartment to cover a filthy wall-to-wall cheap rug.  Six months later, I found a brand-new apartment and decided not to take it with me, so I gave it to a young man who was always having sales and was good at persuading me to buy things at cheap prices which I did not need.  I said, \\"You could probably get fifteen or twenty dollars for it.\\"  He replied, \\"I will clean it and use it myself as I've always wanted an oriental rug and, thanks to you, I'll now have my own.\\" <br /> <br />There is a unique small building in Bearden, near Homberg Place, with rugs painted on the side, and now that branch of the Harb family is going out of business.  Vendors come to one of the malls occasionally and sell these out of a huge tent.  The madder plant is used for dye, as its brillian red hue adds a spark to the handwoven carpets. <br /> <br />It is a famous and durable Turkey Red used in Alladin's Magic Carpet, pictured on the covers of this book.  Wild madder fields abound in Iran.  Three hundred years ago, (1730s) in an obscure footnote in a medical paper by Dr. Calchier, \\"It can turn our bones red,\\" if eaten.  It gets in the skin of the dyers, \\"no amount of washing can get it out.\\"  It's a powerful thing. <br /> <br />A bit of history: Alexander the Great took over Persia in 334 BC (died nine years later).  Mongol conquerors under Genghis Khan invaded this area in 1220 c.  The Taliban took control under Osama bin Laden in 1996, toppled in 2001 by USA.   Elections took place there in 2004.

A child is (under Jewish law) free to argue with parents in private, but must be more circumspect in public.<br /><br />*generally, Jewish law focuses on obligations of material support- understandably given that in an pre-industrial economy, parents' economic power declined as their physical strength declined.  (By contrast, today, even middle-aged children are often dependent on wealthier parents!)<br /><br />*Despite the preindustrial tradition of arranged marriages, rabbis generally (though not unanimously) held that a mature child's interest in picking an appropriate spouse overrode parental objections, based on the theory that marriage and procreation were religious obligations as weighty as honoring parents.<br /><br />*Saadia Gaon wrote that Jewish opposition to nonmarital sex arose from the danger that humans might not know their fathers as a result of unplanned pregnancies.	2005-10-06
US	52009166	R1PGSCU9WGQSRT	0125153929	883404719	An Introduction to the Mathematics of Financial Derivatives, Second Edition (Academic Press Advanced Finance)	Books	2	8	14	N	Y	Attractive at first sight but...	.. not systematic enough on closer perusal. Too often tries to motivate continuum derivations by discrete arguments, and then the continuum argument is presented at best incompletely. I would prefer to see a systematic development with full explanation via Ito calculus, one can then discretize when needed. But the nontrivial stochastic differential equations required to describe real finance market data (the empirically correct equations) dx=R(x,t)dt+&#8730;D(x,t)dB(t) where especially D(x,t) depends nontrivially on both x and t, with x=lnp(t)/po, are not discussed in Neftci or any other financial engineering text.<br /><br />Some bad mistakes in Ito calculus and also conceptually can be found in ch. 21: eqn. (75) is wrong, a partial time derivative is missing on the rhs (there are no stationary processes in finance, including the Osborne-Black-Scholes Gaussian returns model). This mistake propagates into another serious mistake on pg. 285: eqns. (80-82) are certainly neither a backward nor forward Kolmogorov equation, are simply wrong. See either Stratonovich (\\"Topics in the theory of Random noise\\", vol. 1) or McCauley (\\"Dynamics of Markets: Econophysics and Finance\\") for forward and backward time Kolmogorov pdes. See also the basically unreadable but highly stimulating books by Steele (\\"Stochastic Calculus\\") and Durrett (\\"Brownian Motion and Martingales\\")for extensive discussions of the 'Kac-Feynman' formulae and several different pdes (one can follow their discussions of the latter topics).	2005-10-06

Margaret Creighton's book, \\"The Colors of Courage: Gettysburg's Forgotten History\\" (2005) succeeds on both counts. Margaret Creighton is Professor of History at Bard College, Maine.  Her study of the Battle of Gettysburg focuses on the people and groups that frequently do not receive their full due: the Union XIth Corps, composed in large part of German immigrants, slightingly referred to as \\"Dutch\\", and its leaders, the German immigrants in the Borough of Gettysburg, the women of Gettysburg, and the African-American community in Gettysburg and its environs.  Professor Creighton also discusses the \\"Louisiana Tigers\\" a much-feared unit of the Confederate Army.  Each of these groups, Professor Creighton shows the reader, had something at stake in the Battle of Gettysburg over and above the military maneuvers and strategies, and each contributed something important to the result of the battle and to its significance.<br /><br />The book begins with some stage-setting of where each group stood just before the Battle.  Thus the Union XI Corps was smarting from the defeat of the Union Army at Chancellorsville, and it was viewed as the scapegoat because it was the victim of Stonewall Jackson's surprise attack on the far Union flank.<br /><br />Professor Creighton gives a good picture of pre-war Gettysburg, something most other histories treat too lightly. Women of Gettysburg were of varying economic and social status and had to bear much of the brunt of the invasion because many of the men were in military service or had left the town in anticipation of the invasion.<br /><br />Approximately eight percent of Gettysburg's population was African-American.  Most of the African-American population was poor and stuggling, but some individuals had managed to acquire land and property and to attain positions of influence and respect within their community.  With the Confederate invasion, most of the African-American population that was able to do so left town.  And with good reason.  The Southern Army seized African-Americans as \\"contraband,\\" including those who had never spent a day in Southern slavery, and sent them South to a life of slavery.  Professor Creighton describes this well as the \\"reverse Underground Railroad.\\"<br /><br />In Professor Creighton's account, we see how the XI Corps and its leaders tried to redeem themselves at Gettysburg.  She shows how women conducted themselves heroically during the battle by offering a mixture of cooperation with and resistance to the invading troops.  After the Battle, many women in the town made tireless and demanding efforts in caring for the wounded and the dying.<br /><br />There is a great deal of attention paid to Gettysburg's African-American community and how it was changed by the Battle.  I found the discussion of the African-American residents of Gettysburg the most fascinating part of the book and the part which has been least explored in other studies.<br /><br />The book is brought to life by its treatment of individuals as well as groups.  Thus we meet a variety of people in the XI Corps, from its Commander, General Otis Howard, through the German immigrant Generals Schurz and Schimmelfennig on Howard's staff, through the enlisted corporal Adam Muenzenberger who is taken prisoner on July 1 and dies in a prison camp.  We see a great deal of Georgia Wade McClellan and her more famous sister, Jennie Wade, and learn more about them than is usual in battle studies.  We also hear a great deal about Elizabeth Thorn, who in 2002 at last received a monument in her honor.  Mrs. Thorn, pregnant and the keeper of the Evergreen Cemetery provided great and hazardous service before, during, and after the Battle of Gettysburg.  Again Professor Creighton makes nuances and details of her story come alive that often get little attention.<br /><br />The African-Americans described in Professor Creighton's study include Abraham Brian, whose home remains on the Gettysburg Battlefield on Cemetery Ridge at the center of the Confederate attack, the flamboyant Mag Palm, Owen Robinson, a successful businessman, and Basil Biggs, who did a great deal of work burying fallen soldiers after the Battle.  Professor Creighton also uses a great deal of oral histories based upon her interviews with Catherine Carter and Margaret Nutter, descendants of African-Americans in Gettysburg at the time of the Battle.  These sources are unusual and have much to teach about the Battle.<br /><br />Professor Creighton tells her story in a clear, dignified way which, for the most part, is free of polemic.  She reminds the reader that Gettysburg was fought for human freedom and that the goals of the battle and the Civil War, particularly the promise of freedom and dignity to African-Americans, sometimes were forgotten in the spirit of reconciliation that came to pervade American life following Reconstruction.  Professor Creighton tells an important story, or a series of important stories, and she tells them well.  Her book was a pleasure to read and taught me a great deal about the facts and the meaning of the Battle of Gettysburg.<br /><br />Robin Friedmand in Professor Creighton's study include Abraham Brian, whose home remains on the Gettysburg Battlefield on Cemetery Ridge at the center of the Confederate attack, the flamboyant Mag Palm, Owen Robinson, a successful businessman, and Basil Biggs, who did a great deal of work burying fallen soldiers after the Battle.

However, those who make such allegations are ignoring the fact that the author made no claim of firsthand verification for every detail she passes along. Rather, Toth documents what she has seen and experienced...and reports the stories of others, as well...which stories she presents in an \\"as is\\" condition without asking the reader to subscribe to every detail alleged within them. <br /> <br />Even if the entire work were one unbroken stream of fiction this would be a compelling read. The characters here transcend the printed page...forming virtual holograms within the mind of the reader.  <br /> <br />But there is more than a little evidence to support the veracity of Toth's greater vision of a largely ignored subterranean culture existing (if not thriving) beneath the streets of New York City. Toth takes us there and introduces us to ourselves...as we might be if handled as roughly and forgotten so completely as her characters have been. <br /> <br />'The Mole People' is a compelling read. You will likely never forget some of the people Ms. Toth introduces you to. And that's a rare and wonderful gift to receive from a book!	2005-10-06

If we're not living \\"on purpose,\\" our souls can't rest comfortably. ~Martha Beck<br /><br />Stress is the number one killer in America and it is basically a reaction to physical, mental or emotional stimulus that upsets your body's natural balance.<br /><br />By defending yourself during a stressful situation, you are increasing the production of adrenal hormones that end up being responsible for most of the symptoms associated with stress. When the \\"flight or fight\\" response goes unchecked your emotional or physical health can suffer greatly.<br /><br />If you are looking for a comprehensive program, complete with information on the causes and effects of stress, then you will be very impressed with this workshop. Victoria Wizell has created a collection of information about stress to help you understand the reasons you feel the way you do under stress. She then presents effective hypnosis sections to reprogram your mind so you can handle stress more efficiently.<br /><br />What causes stress?<br />What are the main sources of stress?<br />When do most heart attacks occur?<br />What are stress triggers?<br /><br />If the body can be addicted to stress or even fall behind in cell repair when we have reduced rest because of stress, then this program could not only save your life, it could help you live a healthier life. The sections include:<br /><br />History and Facts about Stress<br />How to Cope with Stress and Manage it Through Hypnosis<br />Progressive Relaxation<br />Managing Your Thoughts<br />Time Management - Determining Your Values<br />Dealing with Your Emotions<br />Your Physical Nature<br />Managing Job Stress<br />Managing Your Finances<br />Spirituality: Understanding Your Inner Self<br /><br />Some of the main symptoms of stress include: Muscle tension, fatigue, migraine headaches, back pain, high blood pressure, problems in relationships, shortness of breath, upset stomach, insomnia, loss of libido, hypertension, aggressive behavior, abuse of alcohol or drugs, depression, indigestion, weight gain or loss, obsessions, fears, phobias, anger, low self-esteem, anxiety, withdrawal, feeling bored, inability to concentrate and spiritual emptiness.<br /><br />No matter what you are experiencing currently, hypnosis and knowledge about stress can help you get back on the road to wellness and peace. You will also learn valuable techniques for avoiding stressful situations or putting out the flames when a situation occurs.<br /><br />Victoria Wizell also presents healing thoughts about how to change your stressful situation. You can learn to relax through massage or deep breathing techniques. Just by exercising on a regular basis, you can burn up extra adrenaline. She gives advice on diet and explains the difference between the unconscious and conscious mind.<br /><br />A journal is highly recommended or you can use the Stress Management Workbook to record your experiences. There is an emphasis on accessing the subconscious mind (still under your total control while doing the exercises) in order to reprogram your thoughts. By increasing positive thoughts you decrease turmoil and create a new future.<br /><br />Quick Tips for Dealing with Stress Now:<br /><br />Embrace change with a positive attitude<br />Set realistic goals for your life<br />Exercise and get enough sleep<br />Meditate<br />Resolve Conflicts<br />Try Hypnotherapy - this course is a great place to start and it explores hypnotherapy from many angles.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S.

She has to find a cure to stop humans from turning into werewolves.  Their lives depend on it. HER life depends on it, because she, too, is a werewolf.  The changing disgusts her: the killing, the blood. Elise must find a cure before the next full moon.  Only one person knows her secret, but not the love of her life Nic Franklin.  Elise left him seven years ago when she first changed, without a word of goodbye or an explanation. Now his job has sent him to her lab for answers.  Telling him will reveal secrets best left untold.  Seeing him brings all her dormant feelings back to life, but she can't say anything.  She has to get rid of him, and quickly, before he sees and learns things he shouldn't.<br /><br />Nic Franklin had no idea that his newest assignment would bring him face to face with the woman who gave him a broken heart and many sleepless nights over the years.  Now he needs answers about his list of missing persons.  While questions are being answered, he'd like to know why the woman he loved left him without a word. Seeing Elise again reminds Nic that the flame of love he felt for her never went out.<br /><br />When Elise's lab is blown up, she and Nic find themselves in the middle of a major mystery. Someone is shooting at Elise, her most dangerous test subject managed to escape the inferno, and there are dead bodies disappearing.  Through all of this is the underlying current running between Elise and Nic.  It's almost too much.  As time goes on, Elise begins to embrace the werewolf in her, and begins to take charge of her power.  There are lives to save, answers to be found, and possibly a love to rekindle.<br /><br />Dark Moon is my first read from the Full Moon series.  I have to say, I am sorry I've been missing out!  Elise is a woman who goes from having no friends and staying in the shadows to a kicking-butt and taking-names Alpha female werewolf. Elise's vulnerability is almost tangible, but her slow transformation into an assertive I-am-She-wolf-hear-me-roar makes me crow with delight!  Nic is a delicious man determined to get answers to every question he has, no matter what.  His pain from Elise's sudden departure years ago is still fresh and I feel his pain. His love for Elise is something he doesn't want, but pretty soon stops fighting.  The sexual tension between Elise and Nic makes the pages snap, crackle and pop.  Nic is the perfect Alpha male to compliment Elise.  Despite the deep-seated hurt between them, they still fit together like a puzzle.<br /><br />The secondary characters are witty and full of personality. The small town of Fairhaven, Wisconsin is eerily creepy, the villains are chillingly evil, and mysterious secrets surround this book like London fog.  These secrets can't be uncovered by Colombo or even Sherlock Holmes, only Elise and Nic can unravel them. They search for answers to the many questions, including the one on whether or not their love can overcome these major hurdles.<br /><br />Lori Handeland does for werewolves what Christine Feehan and Sherrilyn Kenyon do for vampires.

War gives expression to our fears, our bloodlust and our inability to fully control this world. We are weak and often corrupt beings. And yet, the human face of war often hides behind body counts, sweeping statements for and against the war, and endless ideologies.<br /><br />In the Purple Sun, Lawrence McAuliffe returns us to the human story revealed in the midst and as a consequence of war. Along the way, he weaves a tale of redemption. On the surface it is the redemption story of one soldier, but it actually explores redemption in multiple lives and possibly even hints at a redemptive path for two nations.<br /><br />While this is not a theological treatise on redemption, McAuliffe  does wrestle deeply with the cost and quest of human redemption. Without being preachy, McAuliffe raises pointed questions about penance, the role of relationships in redemption, and the place of suffering in our lives.<br /><br />God is not directly in the story, but His presence haunts the tale in the midst of human frailty, in the memories of the characters, and persistant calling to follow a path that leads each person to face their own demons.<br /><br />May the tale haunt all its readers with the Sacred Presence.	2005-10-06

Dannie Faber and her husband, Tom, are a couple in their fifties whose relationship, on the surface, appears to be solid. Tom is an anthropology professor at M. I. T. and Dannie is a children's book illustrator. Dannie adores nature and lives in her beach house in Truro from April to November. Tom spends part of the summer in Cape Cod with Dannie, but the two are often apart.<br /><br />Dannie's need to live in Truro goes to the very core of her being. She is fond of gazing at \\"the sky as blue as a Delft plate, and almost cloudless except for a few wisps near the horizon.\\" She and her environmentally minded friends are irate when a wealthy hotel magnate named Mitch Brenner builds a monstrous house in Truro. Dannie is also perturbed when her daughter, Beth, takes time off from work to visit her; Beth is disconsolate after breaking up with her boyfriend, Andy. Dannie's life becomes still more complicated when she becomes romantically involved with her editor, David Lipsett. The Fabers are about to undergo some painful changes and no one will emerge completely unscathed.<br /><br />Anne Bernays examines the well-worn theme of middle-aged angst and she throws in some random comments about religious prejudice, 9/11, and politics. \\"Trophy House\\" is an unfocused novel in which the author fails to adequately explore the minds and hearts of her characters. Although she captures the idyllic beauty of Cape Cod with some fine descriptive writing, Bernays does less well when she depicts the decision to end a marriage as being just another lifestyle choice. Ultimately, it is difficult to care about the quirky, fickle, and shallow characters in \\"Trophy House.\\"	2005-10-06
US	50933475	R1ZWIECA5AI83U	1401206883	498835016	Identity Crisis	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Inconsistent But Worthwhile	Anyway you look at it, this was a watershed event in comics history. The surface story was pretty simple -- a whodunit, in which the super heroes resemble less \\"The Superfriends\\" and more \\"NYPD Blue\\". They band together to find -- oh hell, the Amazon blurb already spoiled it -- the killer of Sue Dibny, wife of Ralph Dibny. A killer who, somehow, overcame a plethora of security devices protecting the home of the secret identity-less Dibny aka the Elongated Man.     But the subplot creeps up on you -- its about what it means to be a \\"caped crusader\\", someone who wears a mask and combats evil. It means your ability to do what you do is protected only by a thin sliver of cloth around your face. (Yes, the glasses of Clark Kent, and the masks of Green Arrow, Robin, Green Lantern and many others would, in the real world, do absolutely nothing to hide their identities, but that's part of the fantasy you have to buy into in the comics world.)     You and your loved ones are constantly at risk -- and paradoxically -- as the revelation at the end of the book reveals -- your loved ones can actually BECOME the danger.   Heroes are people too they have fathers, mothers, children, brothers, sisters and friends and any of them can, in one way or another fall victim to your \\"profession.\\"    Meltzer made a good decision having Green Arrow aka Oliver Queen  narrate the story. He's not mechanical, detached perfectionist that Batman is. He's not Superman the demigod. Wonder Woman is the legend -- the princess; Flash and Green Lantern are the kids and Hawkman is the gruff, no-nonsense warrior.   Oliver is the everyman of the DCU. He's an idealist yes, but more than that, he's a realist. He knows how things could be, his own visions of a perfect world, but at the same time he knows how things ARE. Is it at peace with what he and others did to Dr Light and Batman? No. But he has rationalized it and understands that hard choices will always have to be made and that often in this life, \\"there are no winners.\\"     Meltzer has enraged lots of people sure, many of whom have posted the first reviews here. But no one brushed off IC with a mere shrug, that's for sure. Is this story complete? No not at all -- it sprung off into half a dozen other storylines. However, the cliffhangers don't matter. This is a good, if flawed work that will be pored over for decades to come among comics fans.	2005-10-06

For instance, Stantis' strips on the Terry Schiavo matter gave me more than a few mental grimaces. <br /> <br />And as a life-long fan of the comic strip as an art form, I appreciate that Stantis' work is obviously inspired by the great Jules Feiffer, despite the fact that Feiffer and Stantis are about 180 degrees apart politically (check out any strips where Carmen and Winslow dance, especially.) <br /> <br />Its not screamingly funny, but then I'm coming from a different perspective than Stantis. And as others have pointed out, the repeated fat jokes about Michael Moore are inappropriate. (Yes, I know, liberals made fat jokes about Rush Limbaugh. But Limbaugh regularly made jokes about the height of Robert Reich and Donna Shalala.) <br /> <br />Stantis is also willing to occasionally go after Republicans, too. He's obviously quite dismayed by the current budget.  <br /> <br />Comparing it to the other syndicated conservative strip, Mallard Fillmore, Prickly City wins by a mile. Mallard Fillmore's entire joke boils down to \\"Ha ha, liberals are stupid. Ha ha, look at the stupid liberals.\\" Prickly City goes far beyond that. <br /> <br />I doubt Prickly City will ever become the Doonesbury of the American Right. But its a pretty decent piece of work.	2005-10-06

It is largely this book that provides the foundation of this assessment. Whether one loves Kant or hates him (philosophically, that is), one cannot really ignore him; even when one isn't directly dealing with Kantian ideas, chances are great that Kant is made an impact.<br /><br />Kant was a professor of philosophy in the German city of Konigsberg, where he spent his entire life and career. Kant had a very organised and clockwork life - his habits were so regular that it was considered that the people of Konigsberg could set their clocks by his walks. The same regularity was part of his publication history, until 1770, when Kant had a ten-year hiatus in publishing. This was largely because he was working on this book, the 'Critique of Pure Reason'.<br /><br />Kant as a professor of philosophy was familiar with the Rationalists, such as Descartes, who founded the Enlightenment and in many ways started the phenomenon of modern philosophy. He was also familiar with the Empiricist school (John Locke and David Hume are perhaps the best known names in this), which challenged the rationalist framework. Between Leibniz' monads and Hume's development of Empiricism to its logical (and self-destructive) conclusion, coupled with the Romantic ideals typified by Rousseau, the philosophical edifice of the Enlightenment seemed about to topple.<br /><br />Kant rode to the rescue, so to speak. He developed an idea that was a synthesis of Empirical and Rationalist ideas. He developed the idea of a priori knowledge (that coming from pure reasoning) and a posterior knowledge (that coming from experience) and put them together into synthetic a priori statements as being possible. Knowledge, for Kant, comes from a synthesis of pure reason concepts and experience. Pure thought and sense experience were intertwined. However, there were definite limits to knowledge. Appearance/phenomenon was different from Reality/noumena - Kant held that the unknowable was the 'ding-an-sich', roughly translated as the 'thing-in-itself', for we can only know the appearance and categorial aspects of things.<br /><br />Kant was involved heavily in scientific method, including logic and mathematical methods, to try to describe the various aspects of his development. This is part of what makes Kant difficult reading for even the most dedicated of philosophy students and readers. He spends a lot of pages on logical reasoning, including what makes for fallacious and faulty reasoning. He also does a good deal of development on the ideas of God, the soul, and the universe as a whole as being essentially beyond the realm of this new science of metaphysics - these are not things that can be known in terms of the spatiotemporal realm, and thus proofs and constructs about them in reason are bound to fail.<br /><br />Kant does go on to attempt to prove the existence of God and the soul (and other things) from moral grounds, but that these cannot be proved in the scientific methodology of his metaphysics and logic. This book presents Kant's epistemology and a new concept of metaphysics that involves transcendental knowledge, a new category of concepts that aims to prove one proposition as the necessary presupposition of another. This becomes the difficulty for later philosophers, but it does become a matter that needs to be addressed by them.<br /><br />As Kant writes at the end of the text, 'The critical path alone is still open. If the reader has had the courtesy and patience to accompany me along this path, he may now judge for himself whether, if he cares to lend his aid in making this path into a high-road, it may not be possible to achieve before the end of the present century what many centuries have not been able to accomplish; namely, to secure for human reason complete satisfacton in regard to that with which it has all along so eagerly occupied itself, though hitherto in vain.' This is heavy reading, but worthwhile for those who will make the journey with Kant.h hitherto in vain.' This is heavy reading, but worthwhile for those who will make the journey with Kant.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-06

US	37787548	R3FTYLE9TZ3YUW	140270948X	515416727	Mind-Reading Card Tricks	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Made me an expert at ESP (Extra Special Performances!)	I am an overgrown kid (37 years old) and I've always been tinkering with card tricks of one sort or another.  Recently, I've become interested in doing them again for friends and family.  I bought a few card trick books, and they all had some pretty good tricks, but this book has got a few that'll rattle some brains for your unsuspecting audience (be it one person or 100 people!) <br /> <br />Mr. Mandelberg has included fourteen tricks (or \\"demonstrations\\" as I like to call them.  When you say a card \\"trick\\" it automatically puts the audience on guard.  They'll be watching you twice as closely) in this book, and they are all very well explained and easy to follow.  I also love his writing style, often making me laugh out loud, as Mr. Mandelberg is also a gifted comedian.  He gives performance tips and hints that help spice up the tricks, and before long you can absolutely stun an audience as if you hit them with a taser gun! <br /> <br />I of course will not give any secrets away (buy the book!), but following are some of my favorite tricks from the book: <br /> <br />1.  Behind the Back:  A very simple trick that will amaze whoever sees it.  Like Mr. Mandelberg suggests, you can also let someone in on the solution and play it up very funny. <br /> <br />2.  Under the Table:  Again, very simple, and done with an ordinary deck with no setup.  It will amaze those who witness your \\"mental power\\" (except you, who will be amazed at how easy it is to trick them!  ::devious grin::) <br /> <br />3.  Seven Up:  With a little acting, this trick is very simple and has a good effect. <br /> <br />4.  How Did I Do That?  This trick is really so simple it's laughable, but your audience will never figure it out, and the effect is astonishing!  Mr. Mandelberg also has a fabulous suggestion for the banter on this trick.  He has put a lot of thought into it, and if you carry it out right, the audience will end up believing that they themselves must be psychic! <br /> <br />5.  Switcheroo!:  Takes a little more practice than some others, but the payoff is worth the practice! <br /> <br />6.  What's Your Number?  Mr. Mandelberg says that this trick alone is worth more than the price of the book.  After watching the results, I can say it's worth five times the price of the book!  (I'm sure if you mailed Mr. Mandelberg the other four times the purchase price, he'd really thank you!  Plus, maybe he'd let me have a cut?)  In magic shops, I've paid up to $30 for card tricks that aren't near as effective as this one trick you can do with an ordinary deck!  I've performed this trick among the most cynical, card-trick hatingest people, and after they see it, they just shake their head in utter bewilderment.  I seriously wish I had a camera to record the priceless looks on the faces of those I pull this one on!  And, with just the right banter, even the most skeptical will have to agree that they've witnessed something miraculous! <br /> <br />7.  Neighborhood ESP:  I haven't had the opportunity to perform this one yet, but I relish the day I do!  Like the \\"What's Your Number\\" trick, this one will have people utterly shocked! <br /> <br />Those tricks are some of my favorites, but all of them are good!  I prefer tricks that are a bit more interesting than your run-of-the-mill card trick.  To me, the best tricks are very visual-oriented, ones that have an interesting twist, and this book has some good ones.  And, best of all, they are easy to learn and perform, and when you pull them on somebody, you just sit back and bathe in the adulation they are going to throw your way! <br /> <br />Also, I would be remiss without mentioning the ultra-cool illustrations by Ferruccio Sardella.  Props!	2005-10-06

Kusch writes that the police did not riot or lose control of themselves, which sounds like a stretch, until he convincingly deonstrates his argument with varied evidence and skilled articulation. It's a little slow in the begining but catches fire once the author gets into the street battles that marked the '68 convention.

Yes, the books seems overly sexually horrific because it deals with child abuse and its effects over a persons life. I think that John Irving must be dealing with his own personal issues in this book. The characters are complex dark and rich as usual with John Irving. I loved the books especially the dark humor and usual quirkiness. Complex characters have a great depth that just makes what I usually read seem like pulp fiction. If you can get over the sexual violence with the child abuse and its complex older female characters it is very well worth a great read.	2005-10-06

I seem to be rather in the minority when I say that I actually liked Berlinski's verbose style; frankly, I don't really see what was so difficult to understand about it. On the other hand, I approached this book from the position of wanting something fun to read, and that's what I got, with the welcome addition of what I thought was lovely writing - if I had been searching for something that would give me an in-depth look at calculus, I would have looked elsewhere. Basically, I thought the book was really well-written and exciting (I had just begun calculus when I read it, so I found it really interesting to look at all the stuff we hadn't yet done.), and I highly reccomend it for a piece of fun reading and a decent overview.	2005-10-06

When World War II comes along he is eager to serve his country and to be thrown into the caldron of war. But, by his own admission, he is not \\"simpatico\\" and he always seems to be the square peg trying to fit into a round hole. Perhaps his military career parallels that of the author, Evelyn Waugh.     There is of course no place for Guy in the British Army where his hard work and dedication are little rewarded and his war experiences are spotted with malfortune, little of which is of his own making. Guy \\"blots his copy book\\" early on and ends up being suspected of spying for the Italians. Waugh dots this novel with a cast of clownish characters and comic adventures in which Guy sadly participates.     Waugh's irreverent attitude toward World War II has probably made this novel less popular than it should have been. For example, at the opening of the war, Crouchback wonders why England, in the face of simultaneous invasions of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union, chose to go to war with one and not the other. At another point, Guy muses that \\"he was engaged in a war in which courage and a just cause were quite irrelevant to the issue.\\" In the best Waughian tradition, he does a hatchet job on the much-celebrated Yugoslav resistance movement of Marshall Tito.     Waugh, oddly enough, has also made the interesting comment that he wrote the \\"obituary\\" of the Roman Catholic Church in England with this novel. I take him at his word although perhaps I can't fully appreciate the Catholic subtleties of the novel.     Waugh originally published this novel in three volumes between 1952 and 1962. He then published the three volumes in one, omitting \\"tedious\\" passages. One of the tedious passages he omitted was, to me, the most memorable of the book -- the tale of children evacuated from London at the beginning of the war and thrust, with hilarious consequences, upon the country gentry for caretaking.So, you might read the novels -- Men at Arms, Officers and Gentlemen, and The End of the Battle -- separately as well as together.     Beyond thrillers, World War II seems to have produced few good novels. Waugh's comic, sad, and cynical novel is one of the best.     Smallchief	2005-10-06

One thing I never considered was if I didn't <br />convert and my income went over the threshold allowed by law to convert, I would lose the opportunity to convert the money in the future.   <br />The book covers investing too but is somewhat limited in that area as it mainly is a book of what the Roth is and what  <br />the laws are regarding it.

Ms. Aidan's story could easily have been told in two volumes, with this book left out of the series altogether.  The plot is highly improbable, and there is no character development to speak of.  Jane Austen might have gotten a laugh out of \\"An Assembly Such as This\\", but \\"Duty and Desire\\" surely must have her spinning in her grave. <br /> <br />There's supposedly a third volume... if I could find it, I'd read it, in the hope that it would bear out the potential of the first volume.	2005-10-06

Cretins have deprived children of the works of Helen Bannerman for too long. Her classic story of \\"Little Black Sambo\\" is improved upon here, this time our hero is Quibba, a kind, intelligent boy who cares for his sick mother and goes on a quest to find her mangoes to make her well. A greedy selfish elephant and a crafty snake heed our hero on his quest, but with the help of friend Quibba soon outwits both his enemies and finds a way to get delicious healing mangoes for his mother. The illustrations are charming and simplistic, with bright high-contrast colors, like a child' view of the world.<br /><br />I suppose the US government and the Census would classify us as a mixed race household, but my children, wife, and I are only reminded of it (and offended by it) when we come across the increasingly rare person who can't get past thinking of people first and foremost as colors, rather than using color only to help in a person's description, as is the case with the characters and narrative in this book.<br /><br />And our children love it, this is a top pick when they choose a book themselves. We've never had any \\"black\\" or \\"white\\" questions from any of our kids from reading it, they simply want Quibba to get beat that greedy elephant, outwit that crafty snake, get those mangoes, and dance with joy with his healed mother. Our whole family could not be more charmed by this delightful world.	2005-10-06

US	23708458	R2MJEFNYN8KQY4	1932815147	837224255	Memories of Empire	Books	4	16	17	N	N	Rough, But Compelling	In Memories of Empire, Django Wexler creates a fantasy world with both depth and breadth, pitting numerous nations, factions, and personalities against each other in a setting that oozes with a \\"lived-in\\" feel.  This ambitious debut novel primarily follows the story of Veil and Corvus, an escaped would-be slave and a seemingly unstoppable mercenary, and the story of Kei and Kit, a pair of drake-riders sent to escort an arrogant noblewoman as she hunts a rebel sorcerer.    Wexler lays out a profusion of plot threads and then leaps between them deftly, braiding them into each other one by one until the novel reaches its climax.  While it can be a bit of work to keep track of who's plotting what against whom, the characters are all strongly-drawn and easily distinguished from one another.  The \\"big picture\\" doesn't become clear until the endgame, when no fewer than four factions collide in competition for what are finally revealed to be colossal stakes.    It's all a bit dizzying but, as with Steven Erikson's books, the individual characters make it work.  Wexler makes it easy to cheer for Veil or Kei to get out of various tight corners, even if the reasons they were in those corners to begin with are rarely clear.  While there are plenty of standardized fantasy trappings in evidence, Wexler provides more than enough twists and surprises to keep the whole endeavor from feeling overly-familiar.  And if it's hard to keep track of what's happening when it happens, the ending does an excellent job of revealing who's been doing what to our heroes and why.    It has its flaws, to be sure.  The characters' motivations can come across as murky and arbitrary; in the early going, Veil in particular seems to be \\"going thataway\\" just for want of anything better to do.  And with this many main and ancillary characters roaming the landscape, I do wish Wexler would have chosen names that were as easily distinguishable from on another as the personalities; witness the scene involvingKit, Kei, and Karl.    Most troubling, however, is the wretched condition of the text.  This is, without question, the most poorly-edited novel I have ever purchased.  Medallion Press is a legitimate small publisher, but based on the standards of line-editing represented by Empire, one could be forgiven for thinking they're a vanity press scam-house.  The text is liberally sprinkled with obvious misspellings, spaces in the middle of words, random punctuation and capitalizations, and absent carriage returns.    The typos are merely annoying and unprofessional; it's the missed section breaks that can yank the reader violently out of the story to pause and figure out just what the hell is going on.  The text does no favors in helping the reader keep track of Wexler's numerous plot threads; way too many scenes arbitrarily blur into one another.  The most egregious mistake happens during what were clearly supposed to be a pair of short scenes showing Kit and Kei waking up at their campsite, and then flying above the countryside on their mounts.  With the section break missing, it reads as though the two riders somehow have set up bedrolls and a campfire while in the air.    For the sake of both Medallion Press and its authors, one would hope that the editor responsible for this debacle has been fired and replaced by somebody who knows how to read.    Still, warts and all, Wexler's debut outing is a worthwhile read.  Fans of George R. R. Martin, Steven Erikson, or Japanese anime will find plenty to enjoy.  If you have a taste for Byzantine magic-powered scheming, if you like to see larger-than-life heroes prowling a landscape populated by powerful, cunning spirits and well-developed cultures that feel like they exist even when the reader isn't watching, give this novel a look.	2005-10-06

DeCandido that I enjoyed so, I gave this a chance. While it's not up to the detail and depth of a novel it does help flesh out some from the movie. DeCandido loves the old show Firefly and it shows as there are quite a few references back to it and if your a fan like me you get a little extra out of this that other readers may miss.<br />Late in the book he tends to get pretty redundant with some descriptions.<br />I mean, how many times can Zoe give that \\"fill-in-blank\\" look. This gets pretty annoying after a few times and I couldn't help thinking Decandido was rushing while writing and didn't proof read or the editor failed to do so. I gave it 4 stars but, after further review it'll have to drop to 3 stars.	2005-10-06

It feels intuitively right to me that we would be the most healthy if we as individuals, and as societies, would stop \\"messing\\" with food so much and eat it in as natural a form as possible.  It is arrogant the way modern societies have changed food so much as to be practically unrecognizable from its original and intended form.  We have been playing God thinking that our scientific knowledge can create food that is superior for our bodies (e.g. pasteurization) in the name of food safety and shelf life.  Is it any wonder that people are getting cancer and heart disease like never before in history?<br /><br />However, I am giving it just three stars because I have some real issues with how the ideas in this book are presented.  Jordan Rubin does not seem to acknowledge how truly difficult this diet is to follow in the modern world for most of us.  He makes it sound as if we all can just run on down to our local health food store and all the allowed foods will be waiting there for us.  Fine, perhaps, if you live in a large, relatively liberal city.  For those of us in smaller or even medium-sized towns, this is not quite so realistic.  My city has a health food store, but it is not even close to sufficient for meeting the needs of this diet, particularly when it comes to organic produce.<br /><br />Not to mention, you can pretty much NEVER eat outside of your home if you plan to be truly faithful to this diet.  Rubin says if you break the diet (and you'd better have a very good reason!), just go back to square one (the strictest part of the diet) for a few weeks.  Oh, that's all I have to do??  Not realistic if you want to have ANY kind of social life outside of your own home, if you travel at all, etc...basically if you do anything other than stay holed up in your home all day.<br /><br />I liked that his theories of nutrition are based on the Bible.  Yet, most of the time Rubin simply states, \\"The Bible mentions the use of \\"X\\" food \\"Y\\" number of times.\\" I didn't feel he presented convincing arguments that the Bible mandates us to eat these particular foods in all cases.<br /><br />It turned me off that there is a requirement of buying a whole line of supplements and hygiene products in order to correctly follow his health plan.  To me, that seemed to contradict his message that you shouldn't need all these \\"extras\\" if you were truly eating right.<br /><br />The nutrition information is great, and I do think this book is worth a read to educate yourself about what is and isn't healthy. But I feel this could have been a more effective and palatable message if Rubin presented it in an honest way that acknowledged the difficult barriers that must be overcome to follow this diet. Everything about American agriculture, food processing, packaging, grocery stores, etc. goes contrary to this diet, so it's certainly NOT as easy to follow as he makes it sound.  We don't all have a Whole Foods just down the street from us and a load of cash to spend on organic and specialty foods.  It's too bad it's not that way...believe me, I wish it were...but it just isn't.simply states, \\"The Bible mentions the use of \\"X\\" food \\"Y\\" number of times.\\" I didn't feel he presented convincing arguments that the Bible mandates us to eat these particular foods in all cases.

It covers all battle actions of the boats and what they accomplished in all theaters that the boats operated in -- the South Pacific, the Aleutians, and in Europe and the Mediterranean, an area of the PT boat war that, for some reaon, has had much less coverage than what these boats did in the Pacific.  It also details the origins and developements of the boats, and the vastly complicated logistical problems covering huge distances that often bedeviled the boats and their crews. The book features many photographs of the boats and their crews and how they lived, as well as a complete list of every man killed or wounded on a PT boat during the war, as well as the numerous medals awarded to pt boat crews.  It is a great record of these versatile boats and their courageous sailors.  <br /> <br />Yet, it is a dry history.  There is little or nothing about the men that sailed these boats into harm's way.  Where did they come from?  Why did they choose the dangers of a PT boat?  What led them to go up against destroyers in plywood/mahongeny boats?  A little bit of that and it would have been a fantastic account of the pt boats.  Still, for anyone that loves naval history this is an incredible book.	2005-10-06

Some of the topics covered are denial, fear, adaptation, friendship, loneliness, self-worth, transition,love, trust, and future relationships.<br /><br />I found myself clearly identifying with many of the stages that others go through in a divorce.  It was refreshing to hear what you feel is normal and others feel that way too.  Fisher and Alberti definately speak with insight, and understanding on this topic.  This book was part of the reading along with the a divorce recovery class I took, this book was an important reasource in the class.

Their story was a familiar \\"pretend to be engaged\\" plot device, but I greatly enjoyed the book anyway. The author wrote it well, and the characters are lively. Additionally, there are secondary characters and a side plot that really add to the fullness of the story without distracting from Nick and Molly's romance.

This book set my finely attuned bull**** meter clanging away. When she sticks to her strengths,that is, writing about food, she is an engaging writer. Sadly, this book strays too much into make-believe land. I didn't believe most of the scenarios.Many had the resounding ring of COMPOSITE about them.I don't know---maybe it is because I just saw the film \\"Shattered Glass\\". Most dubious was an episode in which Ms.Reichl conveniently runs into a chic, ultra-sophisticated Hong Kong native who shows her the ropes at a restaurant in Flushing. Too many characters sound made up. Most annoying was Ms.Reichl's foray into pyscho-babble with the 'multiple personalities' that arose from her disguises. Particularly annoying were Brenda Rose and Emily whatever-her-name was (by that point in the book I was fed up with the Six Faces of Ruth). The experiences described in this book, especially, the ending, which I won't give away, are just too pat and convenient to seem like anything but the plot devises of an amateur novelist. I hope for his sake her son is not as cloyingly sweet and goody-goody as he comes off in this book. I'm the mother of three and if my kids were this too-too I'd want to retch. Eyekk.

Either you don't know of all the information that is out there, or you have chosen to ignore it. A case in point is the Institute for Creation Research. To state that the planet is billions of years old without proof is like making something up out of thin air. ICR has plenty of information that makes the world only six thousand years old, not millions or billions. Their exhaustive research has been consistent and proves this. In fact, it has actually backed up Genesis 1, where God created the earth and all the flora and fauna in six literal days. This information at hand not only strengthens the faith, but eliminates the need to change it \\"or else it will die\\". <br /> <br />To switch BC/AD to BCE/CE is an old gnostic heresy redressed for the \\"enlightened modern mind.\\" There is no need to do this. He does this to separate himself from orthodox theology. <br /> <br />Furthermore, Spong is self-aggrandizing and your typical self-serving leftist. He thinks Christianity should be reinterpreted through his vision (and those of his associates). His \\"faith\\" is definitely not in line with the canon of Scripture when everything is taken into context. <br /> <br />This is a book that I could not finish -- nor do I intend to.	2005-10-05

However, it also enriched traditional disciplines in profound and significant ways.  Proponents of Black and Ethnic Studies confronted the false notion that scholarly investigations were objective and unbiased explorations of the range of human knowledge, history, creativity, artistry, and scientific discovery.  As they protested against hegemonic notions like 'universal' psychology and re-evaluated canonical texts in literature, a new model of academic inquiry evolved: one committed to serving a range of populations, that critiqued traditional politics, culture, and social affairs, and worked with activist energy for the transformation of the existing social order.\\"<br /><br />SYNOPSIS<br /><br />\\"In 32 articles, leading scholars examine what the editors call the 'socially engaged field' of Black studies.  They examine the evolution of consciousness, feminist resistance, and the representation of Black men, as well as the conceptualization of culture and ideology.  They also examine Black sexuality, education and religion by analyzing autonomy, subjectivity, the pedagogy and practice of education, and the role of faith in Black life.

No one will know me until fifty years after I'm dead,\\" Scott said.  ~ Excerpt from Joplin's Ghost<br /><br />Tananarive Due's latest release, Joplin's Ghost, exemplifies the restless and wandering spirit of musical genius Scott Joplin.  The title says it all; however, this is more than just your typical ghost story.  Due combines speculative and historical fiction with a splash of romance and urban drama to produce a great story - period.  Joplin's Ghost centers on a young, eclectic, emerging Rhythm & Blues female musician, Phoenix Smalls, managed by an overprotective father and a flashy, high-profile, mega-record producer boyfriend.  As a child, Phoenix suffered through an eerie accident involving a piano which led to months of agonizing rehabilitation.  Shortly thereafter, a foreboding sleepwalking episode finds a ten-year-old Phoenix playing highly complex ragtime scores - years beyond her training.  Nearly a decade later, as her star begins to shine, she somehow channels Joplin's ghost and composes what appears to be scores from his lost opera, A Guest of Honor, inspired by Booker T. Washington's visit to the White House.  Phoenix avidly researches Joplin's life and discovers many uncanny parallels to her own, including a belief that she may be the reincarnation of his wife, Freddy.<br /><br />The Ghost is relentless; the possessions rise in intensity to the point of near-death experiences.  It is during her dreams that Phoenix is transported to Joplin's world, late 19th century Missouri.  Here Phoenix learns that Joplin was hailed the \\"Ragtime King,\\" and at one time celebrated as one of the most sophisticated and tasteful ragtime composers of the era, having unprecedented success with \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" in 1899, and \\"The Entertainer\\" in 1902.  He passionately pursued his great aspirations. Scott Joplin's only surviving opera, \\"Treemonisha\\" unfolds the proud story of an educated daughter of former slaves who rises to greatness in the post-bellum 1800s.  Unfortunately, true greatness eluded Joplin; Treemonisha failed and bankrupted him shortly after its shaky start.  The world was not ready to receive such a progressive tale, leaving the soft-spoken musical genius trapped and victimized by the social ignorance and racial politics of the era.  At times, it seems like Joplin is foredoomed because the opera's failure was not Joplin's only exposure to bad luck, but also because it seemed to plague him all his life: his daughter died in infancy, his first wife abandoned him; his closest brother died prematurely, and his beloved second wife (Freddy) died after only 10 weeks of marriage.  Joplin is portrayed as frustrated, yet still driven; as he suffers a prolonged and agonizing death from tertiary syphilis at age 49, tragically dying heirless and penniless in obscurity in a New York mental ward a few days before the outbreak of World War I.<br /><br />Due is ingenious in that she fuses Treemonisha's message of courage, education, and self-motivation into Phoenix's modern day music to reach and teach today's youth about social responsibility and history. The duality of the novel is that it serves as a wonderfully imagined work on the trials and tribulations of Joplin; and through Phoenix's ordeals with Joplin and other leading characters, Due subtlety mirrors and demonstrates the ill effects of record label rivalry and the  misogynistic, sexual, and violent lyrics commonplace in today's Hip Hop music.  Phoenix and Joplin's bedeviled journey is weird and intense, evolving into a life-altering experience for both beings as Phoenix hurries to free herself and Joplin from their cursed bond.<br /><br />No one knows for sure if Joplin ever stated the prophetic opening quote, but if he did, he was off by only a couple of decades.  \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" and \\"The Entertainer,\\" featured in the 1974 film \\"The Sting\\", earned two Academy Awards for its musical score; and Treemonisha was adapted for a Broadway presentation in 1975, which earned Joplin a special posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1976.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br /><br />APOOO BookClub<br /><br />Nubian Circle Book Clubearned Joplin a special posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1976.   <br /> <br />Reviewed by Phyllis <br />APOOO BookClub <br />Nubian Circle Book Club	2005-10-05

I wanted to read more about how this war came about. <br /> <br />This book was an eye-opener.  What I got out of it was, essentially, that the war in Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power was on the books well before 9/11/01, for a variety of reasons which Hersh discusses in great detail.  How the Bush administration selectively listened to intelligence and data, and how it ignored that which \\"didn't fit its case,\\" is truly astounding -- even if only half of what Hersh writes is true.  It's nauseating to think that my tax dollars are paying the salaries of the \\"war hawks\\" who, more than anything, wanted this war -- and many of these neo-conservatives have been wanting this war since the 1990's. <br /> <br />I am certainly no bleeding-heart liberal.  It's entirely reasonable to get Hersh's point of view since we're constantly inundated with the Bush administration's point of view daily in the news.  Hersh is a first-rate reporter who seems to research what he writes, and he's well known for bringing the My Lai massacre in Vietnam to the forefront. <br /> <br />This book, unfortunately, left me with much less respect for the administration and the DoD, especially the leaders of these departments (the President, the Vice President, and the Sec of Defense).  They really seem to view American \\"grunts\\" as tools to accomplish what they want to do.  And they also punish them (and only them, while the leaders at the top get of scot free) when American policies go bad -- after all, a scapegoat is needed!  Is this democracy? <br /> <br />I'm glad I read this prior to deployment since it gives me more insight into the history of the \\"war\\" -- a mess of a situation, no matter who is analyzing it.  I love this country and am eager to work with my unit and do my job well, but I can't help but feel betrayed by my leaders.  I can't quite take them so seriously anymore, and I'm upset at myself forvoting for George W. Bush -- twice. <br /> <br />Read this book, even if you're afraid that half of what Hersh says may be true.	2005-10-05

Greg Hurwitz has written a number of fine books with nary a miss since THE TOWER, his debut novel. He began a new upward trajectory, however, with THE KILL CLAUSE, the first of his novels to feature U.S. Marshal Tim Rackley, and 2004's THE PROGRAM continued this trend. But neither will prepare you for the masterpiece that is TROUBLESHOOTER. <br /> <br />Any thriller, at its most basic level, needs a good, believable bogeyman that will scare the heck out of the reader. TROUBLESHOOTER has a whole group of them --- a biker gang known as the Laughing Sinners. The Sinners seem to run the streets of southern California with impunity, due to a combination of street smarts, mind-numbing violence, and the legal machinations of a cunning attorney. The book begins with the guarded transport of Den Laurey and Kaner, two members of the Sinners' nomad chapter --- so called because they have no fixed territory or home --- following their arrest for murder. Their brutal and daring escape leads to the formation of a task force charged with recapturing them, with whatever force it takes, and bringing the Sinners down. <br /> <br />Rackley, who is heading up the task force, almost recaptures Laurey but is outmanned and outgunned --- a situation that results in tragic personal consequences for Rackley mere minutes later when his pregnant wife Dray, herself a sheriff's deputy, is attacked and left for dead in the bikers' wake. Rackley must detach his personal grief and desire for revenge from his duties as task force director, even as these elements merge and intersect as the U.S. Marshal's Office and the Sinners play a continuous game of cat-and-mouse for the highest possible stakes. As the task force methodically pursues the gang, it learns that the activities of the Sinners have consequences that will affect not only southern California but also national security. <br /> <br />As always, Hurwitz's research is first-rate; combined with his considerable narrative talents, TROUBLESHOOTER gives the reader an over-the-shoulder view of a counterculture within a counterculture. The Sinners, self-styled \\"one-percenters\\" --- their name based upon the truism that 99 percent of bikers are law-abiding citizens --- are not merely societal nonconformists following a creed of \\"live and let live,\\" but rather are outlaws at war with society, feeding off of it even as they provide vices such as sex and drugs so desired by some. The relationship, subtly but graphically demonstrated here, is more parasitic than symbiotic. <br /> <br />Hurwitz wisely refuses to blur the lines here, choosing instead to paint a clear picture of law enforcement and evil at their respective best and worst while providing a breakneck narrative that races to a conclusion --- two of them, actually --- that will satisfy everyone, on all counts. Ultimately, TROUBLESHOOTER is an undeniable winner. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub	2005-10-05

While I didn't dislike the book so much that I chose not to finish it, I didn't like it enough to be enthused about it. Again, the plot device is a pretend engagement. This time, however, I didn't like Steele's execution of the plot device. There was FAR too much prose and far too little dialogue. Pages and pages of prose do not a fun romance novel make. There was also a shocking exchange between the two in the middle of the book, and it was very difficult for me to forgive (and understand how Varnie would forgive) Leon so easily. Additionally, Steele never shows the man's point of view, which is always a treat and which takes away from the believeability of the development of their feelings for each other. Overall, it was okay, but there are better ones out there. :::::::::	2005-10-05

Many historical inaccuracies appear in the book that would not have appeared if there had been anyone checking for accuracy.  Linklater states that there were three original signers of the Declaration of Independence (there were 5), a major mistake that should have been caught. Another is the fact that he doesn't know one Native Indian tribe from the other and misquotes his sources, when he bothers to note them. Writing a book on both history and science requires that the individual writing such a book should at least have someone double checking his or her accuracy.  There is no or little documentation of where he gets his sources.  His sources are mentioned by page number at the end of the book and you have to guess which quote or information is being referenced.  No end notes or footnotes exist.  As a historian, I have no idea whether or not the scientific end of this book is just as flawed or not, but does make it slightly suspect. <br /> <br />However, Linklater gives an excellent representation of the times, the people involved and the places in surveying and laying out the Trans-Appalachian West.  His character portraits are interesting to read, giving people like Washington, Jefferson, and less known persons such as Masseneh Cutler and Ferdinand Hassler a human look to the reader.  The writing is in narrative format and not difficult.  In fact, it's probably the only book that will actually have the non-scientific reader understanding what all the various confusing measurements mean!  Linklater is a good author, he just needs to have someone go over his facts a bit more strenously and get a better format for his research and his book.	2005-10-05

WHY THE DOUBLE STANDARD!!!! Could it be because you are... WRONG?!    Why your undying love and uncritical acceptance for the industries and politicians and gov't who are daily enslaving you and your children and future generations unborn, indebting you in a fraudulent and usury money system/stock market/credit bubble that will soon collapse and see YOUR entire 401k and stock portfolio and bank savings evaporate with it and you will by force and by necessity work until your dead, reinforcing the invisble, and soon visible, prison bars around you as you gleefully accept and continue in blind obedience and naivety at your dire fate, as you are further entrenched in what will soon (if people like you don't wake from your football and beer and reality TV and celebrity gossip and material perversions and keeping up with the Jones') be a global plantation of tyranny, complete with microchips, single digital currency, forced medication and vaccination, single world army, court, and gov't.    Back to the book, How intellectually bankrupt and unsavvy are you folks that you can't extrapolate further, from his already in depth ideas and instructions, for your need for a specific BRAND OR PRODUCT NAME and hand-holding. HE gives EXPLCIT information, that just armed with that alone, people could heal themselves...   And that information of the cause and inherent cure of almost all disease (incurable and the like) IS:    1. TOXICITY and the necessity to cleanse, most importantly the INTESTINES/COLON... and then the liver, and down the line.    2. NUTRIENT DEFICIENCY - veggie/fruit juicing is the most important restorative of lacking deficiencies -Norwalk juicer is the best    3. Stress    4. EMF/radiation/etc    This short but powerful information expanded on in the book, the basis of disease, and the DEBUNKING of PASTUERS GERM THEORY, which is the foundation of our murderous moderm ALLOPATHIC medical cartel practices, IS ALONG WORTH THE $30.00 for this book...

The laziness and more so, the quickness to lash out at conflicting, accepted, confortable paradigms of life and health that people feel, due to apathy and a sick love of authority figures and gov't satiation, and general disrespect for individual responsability and power.. If you are too lazy to read above 5th grade level books, which Natural Cures certainly is as far as details, data, and theory, THEN BUY THE AUDIOBOOK and listen as Kevin talks for over 12 hours... Listen to the sincereity, the honesty, the concern and caringness this man has for YOU, although for most people it is unwarranted...   Listen to the logic, the sensability, the self-empowerment given, the hope given, to the disgust of the Elite and their lust and greed and disregard for all of humanity, white, black, religion aside...   As Kevin T. expresses, and I feel wholeheartedly, is disgust for my fellow, apathetic and compromising and brain dead peers.  Not everyone is like this, but 99% of society, especially the silver spoon fed American society, can not think for themselves, and the bigger the budget, the nicer the suit, the fancier the TV presentation, the more degree'd the talking head or \\"expert,\\" the more credible and honest and caring somehow the information being presented is... HOGWASH... this is THE reason to NOT believe it and critically and skeptically examine and reference and research the information and laws.    To Kevin, I am 26 now and have been a health crusader and Conspiracy researcher and whistle blower myself for about 12 years now... at the expense of people thinking I am crazy, delusional, dangerous, and even anti-American, etc...   As you have come to realize, these things are part of the territory of trying to get people to rise up, wake up, and reclaim not only their birthright of true health and prosperity and clarity of mind, but of their sovereignty, their freedom of speech, their freedoms, the inherent power that the masses have, and the New World Order and GLOBAL FASCIST POLICE STATE AGENDA that is almost complete.. and the degredation, dismantling, and soon illegality of health rights, freedoms, organic food choice, CODEX abolishing natural supplement access, etc  are just part of the plan for takeover and democide and genocide of masses..    Everyone, to wake up read books by David Icke, Jim Marrs,   G. Edward Griffin, Rich Anderson (Cleanse and Purify Thyself 1 and 2), Gary Null, Leonard Horowitz, Jim Keith, David Wolfe, Ralph Epperson, etc....    Most importantly, QUITE giving your power away to Elite; mentally, emotionally, physically, and creatively..  They don't care about you, they lie with every breath, and genuinely want to enslave you if you don't stay vigilent and oppose injustice, accept tyranny, and are apathetic to the atrocities and crimes the gov't,on the people's behalf (and with the American peoples approval, in the eyes of all innocent foreigners who have contempt for our apaty and indifference to their suffereing), etc...

Schmidt's thesis concludes that the powers-that-be of LalaLand have used the persuasive power of the press(specifically Harrison Grey Otis and the L.A. Times)  and the entertainment industry(movies and television) to provide role models for L.A...ones which strive to inculcate the virtues of self-reliance, justice and respect for the law, albeit safely within the confines of the prevailing political power structures. At best, they would create model citizens who would imitate these qualities and thrive in a community of hard-working and productive law-abiding citizens...but without the political and progressive independence which would jeopardize the status quo.  At worst, they encouraged a passive and subservient relationship to those in power. <br /> <br />According to Schmidt, after the riots of 1965 put paid to the loftier model described above, this strategy, further championed by L.A. police chief William H. Parker and exemplified by the 1950's incarnation of television's Dragnet, devolved into a rather cynical attempt to train Los Angelenos to respect the law and accept the fact that their city was a dystopian wasteland.  They had better get used to the fact that they may be forced to cooperate with the police at any given time.  In other words, keep your nose clean, don't rock the boat, and cooperate with the powers-that-be. <br /> <br />Schmidt makes it clear that to imitate (but not strive beyond) the populist vision of America, the individualist who by definition followed no particular drummer is an inherent paradox, and that such a strategy is doomed to failure. In his final chapter, he uses the themes of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner as an example of what such an approach might have in store for Los Angeles if taken to the nth degree.  Foodfor thought for Los Angelinos and those interested in the plight of urban communities everywhere.  I must also mention that there are photographs (many saturated with irony), and illuminating (and where Dragnet is mentioned, very funny) endnotes. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-05

There have been many books that have had the title 'Book of Common Prayer' since the first one appeared in 1549; it has been used continuously in one edition or another in the Anglican tradition since 1559; the 'main' edition remains this 1662 edition. Churches in other nations (Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the United States, Canada) have done revised Books of Common Prayer, but they always use this as the touchstone.<br /><br />A bishop in the Episcopal church once said to me, 'We don't have a theology that we have to believe -- what we have is the prayerbook.' Please forgive the absence of context for this phrase -- while he would say that this statement in isolation is an exaggeration, and I would agree, nonetheless his statement serves to highlight both the importance of and the strength of the Book of Common Prayer.<br /><br />To be an Anglican, one does not have to subscribe to any particular systematic theological framework. One does not have to practice a particular brand of liturgical style. One does not have to have an approved politico-theological viewpoint. One can be a conservative, liberal or moderate; one can be high church, low church, or broad; one can be charismatic, evangelical, or mainline traditional -- one can be any number of things in a rich diversity of choices, and the Book of Common Prayer can still be the book upon which spirituality and worship is centred.<br /><br />The Book of Common Prayer is not, in fact, a book that changed my life. It is a book that changes my life. Even though it is not the primary book of my own church, it continues to provide for spiritual insight and development; it continues to guide my worship and my theology. It continues to help me grow. The words are part of a liturgy now shared by Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian and other liturgical churches, in different combination and priority.<br /><br />Gerry Janzen, an Anglican professor at my seminary, said to me recently as we were lunching and having a fascinating and wide-ranging conversation (in a unique way that only Gerry Janzen is capable of doing) that he strives for that kind of memory and understanding that is so complete that one forgets what one has learned. He recounted to me his experience of working with his book on Job -- he had done a lot of research, development of ideas, writing, and organisation, and then set it aside for a time. When he picked up the topic later, he decided to begin by writing, and then go back to the research, other notes and writings he had done earlier. He was surprised to see, in comparing the work, that he had in fact duplicated much of the material -- he had internalised the information, incorporated it so well into his thinking and being, that it came forward without effort. It is this kind of relationship I feel I have developed with the Book of Common Prayer.<br /><br />To be sure, there are pages of information that I don't know. I haven't memorised the historical documents; I still consult the calendars; I haven't learned all of the collects by heart. But it has become a part of me. When was asked to put together a liturgy for a houseblessing for Episcopalian friends, there were rooms that called for collects that had not been written -- I wrote new collects and inserted them into the liturgy.<br /><br />'Can you do that?' the householder asked, worried about the flow and the approval of the priest doing the blessing.<br /><br />'I trust Kurt to write collects -- his probably belong in the BCP,' the priest said in response, and I appreciated her vote of confidence. That was perhaps the first confirmation to me of this sense of incorporation of the book into my life.<br /><br />From his first edition, Cranmer distinguished in his terminology the words minister and priest, and the two should not be viewed as interchangeable. A priestis a minister, but a minister need not be a priest. This become part of the early development of the idea of all people being ministers to each other, which is also a concept that has varying acceptance and fulfillment in actual practice over the history of Anglicanism.<br /><br />One of my favourite prayers derives from this book, part of the English prayer book from the very first one in 1549:<br /><br />Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication unto thee, and hast promised through thy well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his name, thou wilt be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be best for us, granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come, life everlasting. Amen.<br /><br />This prayer, like many things in the BCP, has moved to a new location from the first edition, but nonetheless the spirit of the BCP shows a circuitous but continuous development from the first English Prayer Book to the current varieties. Likewise, other denominations have gleaned insights, prayers and structures from this and other versions of the BCP.<br /><br />The Book of Common Prayer, as a single unit and as a greater tradition of which this book is a part, is an Anglican gift to the world.terchangeable.

Still could not cook.<br /><br />Picked up this book at a flea market ( the 1963 printing ).<br /><br />This book is incredible.  My kids not only will eat the food, but they love it. ( and they demand the food now ).<br /><br />I do not agree with other reviews about complexity and cost of the recipe's.  She provides both easy and complex recipes.<br /><br />The recipes are well thought out, with step by step insrtructions and illustrations.  The illustrations are priceless, cooking is alot of technique, and the illustrations walk you through it.  Every question I would have had about the ingredients or prep are covered.<br /><br />Oh, and ingredients..  She assumes that the grocery store is the only place you have to shop. So she notes how to adjust for canned or frozen vs fresh, and what you can substitute.  Not some cute ethnic market in New york city where everything is always in season from the 4 corners of the world.  You can literally take the book to the grocery store to buy your ingredients. and come out with everything you need.  ( I have a 40 year old copy of this book, and Julia's assumptions about what I will be able, and will not, to find in my grocery store is 100% correct. )<br /><br />Crepes - been trying for a year to make the kids crepes. tried several recipes online.  failed.  first attempt with Julia, and voila crepes.<br /><br />Omlette - so I could always make an omlette.  or at least I thought. now I am an omlette gourmet cook.<br /><br />I cannot wait to graduate to her other cookbooks.	2005-10-05

I know Laila from her blog. So I know this is her first book and I know the steps she has taken to get here, but even so, as I read this book, it was difficult to believe that it was a debut. The writing, to me, seems incredibly seasoned--clean, efficient, evocative. Essentially, I forgot that this was Laila writing within the first few words and, instead, fell into the world as it was written.    The protagonists of these stories are Moroccans looking for a different (I would say better life but I'm not sure that's true--many of them, though anxious to get across the Strait of Gibraltar, are fearful of what life on the other side will hold) life in Spain. Ironically, the one person who actually makes it without being deported back to Morocco, does so at great personal expense. She makes her living as a protitute, leaving behind her morals and beliefs. She is, essentially, lost.     My favorite character is Halima, who tries to leave Morocco in order to save herself and her children from her husband. Instead, she almost loses everything, except that her young son saves the family from drowning in the frigid waters. It is because of this that she believes he may be special, but the truth is that it is she and her enduring hope which make her the special one--the survivor, the saint.     The book ends with another favorite character, Murad, the scholar, the writer. It is from him, the storyteller, that we learn the essence of this book:   His father started every story with \\"Kan, ya ma kan,\\" \\"Once there was and there was not.\\" The timeless opening line was fitting, it seemed to him, to the state he found himself in now, unable to ascertain whether the tales he remembered were real or figments of his imagination.  It is that sense of rebirth, creation, crawling from the water into a new world that proves itself unreal, only to be sent back and to begin again--to forget and to remember, but to always be present and to always hope, no matter what the consequences. And what we learn is that this book is not only about Moroccans looking to escape to a different life, but about all of us who have hopes, who wish to overcome. It is universal.     A beautiful debut. Read it.	2005-10-05

I love the way Watterson writes, and of course, there is the comic itself, which I have always loved. There is something so wonderful about this comic that has stayed with us, even 6 years after the last strip was printed, which I think is an accomplishment within itself; there are very few comic strips that have been able to hold our attention even after the last strip has been printed, and all this without the benefit of movies, or tv shows, or mass marketing of products related. It goes to show the brilliance of the writing of the strip itself. I find there are moments of sheer comic laugh out loud moments, and there are the moments that are poingnant. This collection is an excellent dedication to the series, and to the fans, whom I hope, like me, will cherish this for many more years.	2005-10-05

First off I am so glad it's been written. So glad that there is something that can be put into other people's hands that examines this ridiculous opposition to gay marriage with a sense of humor, heart, and a little thing called facts. (Something the Christian right likes to forget about in their pursuit of oh so compassionate discrimination.) What I love about the book is he doesn't moralize, and tell anyone what they should do, instead it's simply the journey that he and his boyfriend Terry go through. That process manages to create a myriad of viewpoints that structures much of the book's backbone, from his pressuring Mother, to his brother adopting a somewhat \\"gay lifestyle\\" in regards to co-habitating with his girlfriend, and their somewhat open relationship.<br />My son is two and it can be incredibly frustrating and sad listening to these Bible Thumping Red State Imbeciles spouting just plain lies in the name of Jesus to create a political victory.  Luckily this book was a reminder that regardless of what careless and nasty things have been said or will continue to be said about gays and their rights to marriage and children, love is ultimately what makes a family. Love makes a commitment, and sometimes that's loud enough to drown out all the other white noise.	2005-10-04

Byatt's _Possession_ that got me addicted to the historical-interest mysteries that are in vogue lately. I've come to really love the sort of book where people hunt around looking for ancient artifacts or long-lost manuscripts. So I couldn't resist picking up _The Seventh Unicorn_, which tells the story of a (fictional) seventh tapestry in the (real) \\"Lady and the Unicorn\\" series, and two former lovers who rekindle their romance while trying to preserve it. <br /> <br />This book is not bad at all. It is, however, a first novel, and there are two things about it that just didn't work for me. First, the male lead, Jake, doesn't appeal to me as much as he's supposed to. Even if he was having problems with his fiancee before running into his former lover, he would have at least spared his fiancee half a thought in the course of several hundred pages. Instead, she seems to vanish for about two-thirds of the book and is much less important to the story than she should be. <br /> <br />Second, the author was perhaps a bit too easy on the characters. I'm used to novels like this having some conflict--some cutthroat tactics, some suspense, at least some interpersonal tension. Instead, the denouement of this book seems to be a series of things falling too perfectly, too easily, into place. Characters I thought were menacing turned out to be merely gruff but well-meaning. Exes who should have been bitter, instead smile and nod magnanimously. And the Deep Dark Secret that underpins the story was too easily guessed. I think the prologue telegraphed far too much of the plot. <br /> <br />Again, this book was not bad at all, and I did like it. However, I think it needed some more conflict. It was just a bit too placid.	2005-10-04

Emma Holly has managed to make an extremely appealing and unique race of bloodrinkers. They are sexy, sensitive and intelligent. The only problem for them is exactly how long they really live. The sad truth of their lives is that so few beings have the stamina for immortality.  <br />The upyr were worried about Lucious. The world seemed to mean nothing to him. He was merely existing with no attachment to the world other than his companion Edmund, a younger upyr.  A chance encounter with a dying man on the road leads Lucious to an important turning point.  He assumes the identity of this man, and is thrust back into the world of the living where he meets Theo Beckett. <br />Theo was a wonderful female character. She was supporting her family and being a good sister and all the time not really understanding what was missing in her life until she meets Lucious. She has lived her whole life in the shadow of her older, but very loving and supportive sister, Caroline.  Theo and Lucious have a series of intimate encounters that force Lucious, out of guilt, to wipe them from her mind. He then resolves to try to win her love like a human man.  She ends up thinking that she dreamed the intimacies with him, and is very confused by her feelings about a man that she initially wanted for her sister.   There is never any doubt though who he really wants.  <br />This was a truly satisfying story. I have said this before, but I really like a story where the two main characters can at least admit to themselves that they want each other. You know there will be difficulties, but the strength of their bond is true.  <br />	2005-10-04

Merrill has plowed obscure historical references and consulted with scores of historians to recreate what surely must have transpired some two millennia ago in Palestine. And if, as a previous reviewer has noted, some of the deliciously drawn characters are more than coincidental reminders of present day political figures, this is a playfully provocative and mischievous bonus. <br /> <br />A subplot includes a secular portrayal of Mary (Miriam), Joseph and boy Jesus. Although at variance to the Biblical account of their origins and travail, the novel should not considered heretical since the plot is pinioned by historical fact, and the future of a brilliant young Jesus is left in abeyance.  <br /> <br />There are a surprisingly large number of protagonists and antagonists. Each has his/her own individuality. The plot follows a series of frissonic struggles among Sadducees, Chief Priests, Romans, and Zealots as it builds towards the final battle near Megiddo. The description of this battle is as good as anything John Keegan has written, even though we know what the outcome will be. The line of battle, strategies, tactical use of weapons are fiercesomely described. (Howard Fast's novel, Spartacus, and its movie counterpart are made reminiscent by this powerful account.) <br /> <br />I certainly would look forward to a sequel which should involve an adult Jesus, Pontius Pilot, John the Baptist, Josephus, and the later, final stand of the Zealots on Masada against Flavius Silva. I have recommended Sons of Light to friends of mine who are historians (and to an Israeli epidemiologist who has told me about the reverence and respect that the \\"Sons of Light\\" have today in the museums of Israel). This book is worth the price and the time to read it. <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

Tolkien's vision.  Although the movies are remarkable, necessarily due to time constraints, they are nowhere near as complex in plotline and characters as the book.<br /><br />This book deserves to be an all-time classic, not only in the fantasy genre, but in the general literature genre.  It is the one book I would want if I were to be confined to a desert island.<br /><br />\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" in all its brilliance provides me not only with one of the most remarkable sagas ever created, but gives me an entire world devoted to the pursuit of good for the sake of others as well as self.<br /><br />Who can forget the sacrifices Frodo and Sam made in order to destroy Sauron?  Who can forget the bonds created in the fellowship, leading even a dwarf and elf to become true friends?<br /><br />Even the more minor characters are well-drawn, not the \\"cardboard characters\\" so prevalent in other fantasy books.<br /><br />This book almost demands multiple readings, as it is too immense to digest in only one.  I have owned the beautiful red edition for about twenty to twenty-five years, but read it only once a year.  I have read and re-read,until they fell apart,at least three paperback editions of the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all serious readers who wish to immerse themselves in the book of a lifetime.	2005-10-04

I found that I could not even put it down! There is something wonderful about reading a book that focuses on people's lives and how they overcame terrible situations. \\"Appetite for Life\\" approaches eating disorders from a different angle, and I have already told all my friends, especially those with young daughters, to read it!	2005-10-04

And the storybook format makes it more likely that the messages will be reinforced by the parent or family member reading to their child.  Several important fire safety rules are included; don't hide in the burning building, get low and crawl to safety, get out of a burning building quickly, meet at the agreed-upon meeting place, call 911, don't go back into the burning building, etc.  A delightful and important book for young children.	2005-10-04

US	23634769	RY0VR2ZVC581O	0889652015	594118800	Harry Potter and the Bible : The Menace Behind the Magick	Books	1	16	24	N	N	Christian Fundamentalism	This book is a pack of lies would have given it 0 stars if i could. Harry Potter teaches children to stand up to your friends and to respect the other person no matter where she or he came from, what religion they have, or what they read. For example Lilly Potter died for her son to protect him from Lord Voldemort. She sacrificed herself for her son, like Jesus our savoir freed us from our sins.  <br /> <br />Actually I can only quote a good friend of mine \\"False faith and witch fear are things, which harm the Christian Faith more then any occult. The fundamentalist church builds its power on lies! What became of the rock, on which Jesus wanted to establish its church?  A rotten bit stone? If the faith will be kept upright by lies only, then it is worth nothing. <br /> <br />\\"Love your neighbour as you do yourself.\\" Matthew 19:19   <br /> We are disobeying Christ's word by burning books, starting wars in the name of god and Jesus and burning books .Don't get me wrong,, there are some wonderful organisations sponsored by the church, which are dedicated to helping others, but this book is just being intolerant and silly. Harry Potter will lure nobody to occultism. Some kids even started to read more as a result of Harry Potter.  <br /> <br />We can not live in the 2nd century anymore we as human being have to progress. <br /> <br />                Namri	2005-10-04

People who can't write the best epics houldn't at all. You're why Portuguese lit. sucked so long.  <br /> <br />The real gem here, though, is the information on early motorcycles. There's a whole world out there. I myself have purchased an old Ninja, favored among the ancient armies, solely based on this book. It has been the source of innumerable hours of pleasure.	2005-10-04

I've been reading golf books for thirty years and this one has to be in the top five of the worst I've ever read. As I was reading this I noticed that I was reading the same paragraph, word for word, only in different chapters. If you want to read good books on Pinehurst stick with anything by Lee Pace. <br />	2005-10-04

Those suckers are in there tight! I'll have to treat this with baby hands.<br />What can I say? This is a great collection for a great comic-strip. It was a sad day years ago when Bill called it quits on the strip, but it's nice to have all of them collected within this keepsake.<br />I have heard a rumor that a couple of the strips have been edited because they contained content of Calvin being adopted. See this link: [...]<br />I haven't gotten that far into my rereading of these strips to see if that is indeed true, but it's no big deal to me.	2005-10-04

Let me start my review by saying that Kurt Busiek is a great writer, and I know that Astro City is a sacred cow in some circles, but I'm going to give it to you straight. There is only so much you can do with the viginette format, and this trade reflects that.  <br /> <br />The stories in here are good but nothing that will make you jump out of your seat or even rush out and pick up the next ones, which is a shame, because Busiek really is a tremendous writer, and Confession and Family Values (full lenght stories) are great Astro City trades.  <br /> <br />I hope the three star rating doesn't turn you away from Astro City beacuse there really are a lot of reasons to read it-- it expands your horizons (you're getting more than Batman and Xmen here) and also, Busiek writes super-heroes how the should be, in the idealized version of the word. After Frank Miller and Alan Moore began disecting heroes in the 80s, it seems as though we just kept racing to the bottom making them as facist and as emotionally fragile as they can be. Well Busiek bucks this trend and makes super heroes super again. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad, and some kind of way (hey, he's Busiek) he manages not to write down to us, treating us like where kids. So there are a lot reasons to read Astro City. And even more reasons to read Busiek. But this particular trade, when I compare it to other Astro City trades (Family Album and Confession) and to other Busieks (Marvels, Superman: Secret Identity) and even to other graphic novels out there, is only good. <br /> <br />Read Astro City, it really is good, but there are better ones, but above all, just make sure you read and own, some Busiek.	2005-10-04

That was almost 10 years ago!  The other day I read it again and still gave me a little chill to read it.  It was my favorite book in the entire 56 book series.  My second favorite one was #25 The Ghost of Blackwood Hall.  The book's chapters flow nicely together and there is never a dull moment in the entire story.  The basis of the book is Nancy's boyfriend Ned Nickerson is kidnapped and Nancy is determined to find him and find out who Cyclops is what they have to do with Ned or if they have anything to do with Ned's disappearance.  This book is a definte must read!	2005-10-04
